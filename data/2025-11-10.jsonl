This research is motivated by\ntwo critical challenges: limited coverage provided by mmWave frequencies and\nhigh infrastructure costs associated with current technologies. IRSs can help\neliminate these issues because they can reflect electromagnetic waves to\nenhance signal propagation, thereby reducing blockages and extending network\ncoverage. However, deploying a separate IRS for each mobile network operator\n(MNO) can result in inefficiencies, redundant infrastructure, potential\nconflicts over placement, and interoperator interference. To address these\nchallenges, in this study, an IRS sharing system is proposed in which multiple\nMNOs collaborate to use a common IRS infrastructure. This approach not only\nenhances network flexibility and reduces costs but also minimizes the effect of\ninteroperator interference. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that IRS\nsharing effectively balances performance and fairness among MNOs, outperforming\nMNO-specific deployment methods in multi-MNO scenarios. This study provides\ninsights into the potential of IRS sharing to support sustainable 6G networks,\nthereby contributing to the efficient deployment and operation of\nnext-generation wireless communication systems."}

The proposed\nalgorithms are derived using a theoretical channel model and validated and\nnumerically evaluated using an empirical dataset containing channel\nmeasurements from an indoor distributed Massive MIMO testbed. When dealing with\nmeasured CSI, the impact of the hardware, in addition to the location-based\nchannel, needs to be compensated for. We propose a method to calibrate the\nhardware and achieve measurement-based evaluation of our location-based\ninterference suppression algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethods allow location-based interference suppression without explicit CSI\nknowledge at the transmitter, under certain realistic network conditions."}
