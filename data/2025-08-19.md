TL;DR: Vibe2Spike是一个无电池无线传感框架，利用压电盘、齐纳二极管和LED组成的超低成本标签，通过可见光通信和脉冲神经网络实现振动活动识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传感解决方案在电池维护、无线传输开销和数据处理复杂性方面面临能量、可扩展性和可靠性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用压电盘收集振动能量，通过LED发射稀疏可见光脉冲，事件相机捕获光学脉冲，使用EONS框架优化的脉冲神经网络模型进行分类。

Abstract: The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing
ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle
with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery
maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In
this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing
framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light
communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses
ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and
an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes
without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by
event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS
framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\%
average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs
of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable,
and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a
batteryless manner.

Abstract: Data-driven radio frequency (RF) tomography has demonstrated significant
potential for underground target detection, due to the penetrative nature of RF
signals through soil. However, it is still challenging to achieve accurate and
robust performance in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a
data-driven radio frequency tomography (DRIFT) framework with the following key
components to reconstruct cross section images of underground root tubers, even
with significant changes in RF signals. First, we design a cross-modal sensing
system with RF and visual sensors, and propose to train an RF tomography deep
neural network (DNN) model following the cross-modal learning approach. Then we
propose to apply continual learning to automatically update the DNN model, once
environment changes are detected in a dynamic environment. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves an average equivalent diameter error of 2.29
cm, 23.2% improvement upon the state-of-the-art approach. Our DRIFT code and
dataset are publicly available on https://github.com/Data-driven-RTI/DRIFT.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide,
accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with
timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive
method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for
diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG
data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the
statistical properties of real data without compromising patient
confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for
training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and
evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification
performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models
to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval,
QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we
leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG
signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether
transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better
utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets. Our findings
demonstrate that transfer learning from regression to classification improves
classification performance, highlighting its potential to maximize the utility
of available data and advance deep learning applications in this domain.

Abstract: Objective: Sparse Bayesian learning provides an effective scheme to solve the
high-dimensional problem in brain signal decoding. However, traditional
assumptions regarding data distributions such as Gaussian and binomial are
potentially inadequate to characterize the noisy signals of brain activity.
Hence, this study aims to propose a robust sparse Bayesian learning framework
to address noisy highdimensional brain activity decoding. Methods: Motivated by
the commendable robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion for
handling complex data distributions, we proposed an MEE-based likelihood
function to facilitate the accurate inference of sparse Bayesian learning in
analyzing noisy brain datasets. Results: Our proposed approach was evaluated
using two high-dimensional brain decoding tasks in regression and
classification contexts, respectively. The experimental results showed that,
our approach can realize superior decoding metrics and physiological patterns
than the conventional and state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Utilizing the
proposed MEE-based likelihood model, sparse Bayesian learning is empowered to
simultaneously address the challenges of noise and high dimensionality in the
brain decoding task. Significance: This work provides a powerful tool to
realize robust brain decoding, advancing biomedical engineering applications
such as brain-computer interface.

Conclusion: 闭环CECGSR方法为心电图超分辨率提供了更优的解决方案，具有负反馈机制和近零稳态误差的优势，能够有效提高低分辨率心电图信号的质量。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and
treatment of various cardiac diseases. ECG signals suffer from low-resolution
(LR) due to the use of convenient acquisition devices, as well as internal and
external noises and artifacts. Classical ECG super-resolution (ECGSR) methods
adopt an open-loop architecture that converts LR ECG signals to
super-resolution (SR) ones. According to the theory of automatic control, a
closed-loop framework exhibits superior dynamic and static performance compared
with its open-loop counterpart. This paper proposes a closed-loop approach,
termed circular ECGSR (CECGSR), which models the degradation process from SR
ECG signals to LR ones. The negative feedback mechanism of the closed-loop
system is based on the differences between the LR ECG signals. A mathematical
loop equation is constructed to characterize the closed-loop infrastructure.
The Taylor series expansion is employed to demonstrate the near-zero
steady-state error of the proposed method. A Plug-and-Play strategy is
considered to establish the SR unit of the proposed architecture, leveraging
any existing advanced open-loop ECGSR methods. Simulation experiments on both
noiseless and noisy subsets of the PTB-XL datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CECGSR outperforms state-of-the-art open-loop ECGSR algorithms in the
reconstruction performance of ECG signals.

Conclusion: 该工作为跨数据集情感识别提供了一个有前景的解决方案，通过精确的特征对齐和噪声鲁棒性处理有效提升了识别性能

Abstract: Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research
direction in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the
introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development
of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences
between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and
equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges,
especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems,
we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning
to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier
discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a
dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a
three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and
minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision
boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers
also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise
cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise
learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity
problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted
systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED,
SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior
to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the
average accuracy improvements of 4.76\% and 3.97\%, respectively. Our work
provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source
code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/Mcd_PL.

*Zahra Mohammadi,Parnian Fazel,Siamak Mohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于单导联电心图的能源效率睡眠分期分类系统，通过轻量级深度学习模型实现高准确度和低能耗，适用于可穿戴式长期监测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统睡眠监测方法如多导联睡眠检测成本高且不适合家庭长期使用，需要更实用的可穿戴解决方案

Method: 提出两种窗口策略：5分钟窗口用于机器学习模型，30秒窗口用于深度学习模型；设计了轻量级自定义模型SleepLiteCNN，并应用8位量化技术

Result: MobileNet-v1模型达到92%准确度和91% F1分数；SleepLiteCNN模型在保持89%准确度的同时，将能耗降低至5.48微焦耳每次推理，FPGA部署证明低资源占用

Conclusion: 该系统为基于单导联电心图的连续可穿戴睡眠监测提供了实用解决方案，在保持高准确性的同时显著降低了能消耗

Abstract: Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders
such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like
polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present
an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light,
and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1)
a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use
handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for
deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight
networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score
but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom
model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering
energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit
quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment
confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution
for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.

### [8] [Explainable Deep Neural Network for Multimodal ECG Signals: Intermediate vs Late Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11666)
*Timothy Oladunni,Ehimen Aneni*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了多模态深度神经网络在ECG心血管疾病分类中的融合策略，发现中间融合比后期融合效果更好，达到97%准确率，并具有更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单模态深度学习模型容易过拟合且通用性有限，而多模态融合策略在高风险临床应用中的最优方案仍不明确，特别是在ECG心血管疾病分类中。

Method: 使用ECG信号的三个域（时间、频率、时间-频率）进行中间融合（特征级）和后期融合（决策级）的对比实验，通过显著性地图和相互信息进行可解释性分析。

Result: 中间融合策略在所有实验中都表现更优，达到顶峰97%的准确率，相比单模态模型Cohen's d > 0.8，相比后期融合Cohen's d = 0.40。

Conclusion: 基于ECG域的多模态模型提供了更优的预测能力和更好的可解释性，超越了现有最先进模型，在医疗AI应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency
to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal
fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability
of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust
and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate
fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains
insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as
ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates
the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using
ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series
of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion
architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently
outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's
d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion.
Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align
with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the
discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was
confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based
multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced
explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing
state-of-the-art models.

### [9] [Neural Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11668)
*Muhammad Umer,Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin,Ahsan Bilal,John M. Cioffi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: nGRF是一种基于3D高斯原语的神经网络框架，用于高效准确地合成复杂信道矩阵，解决了传统CSI估计在移动性下的性能瓶颈问题，在室内外环境中均表现出显著的性能提升和效率改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线网络中，准确的信道状态信息(CSI)是主要瓶颈，导频开销占用11-21%传输带宽，增加20-40%延迟，降低53%以上频谱效率。传统估计技术在移动性下失效，即使4ms的反馈延迟也会导致50%吞吐量下降。

Method: 提出neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF)框架，利用显式3D高斯原语合成复杂信道矩阵。与基于NeRF的慢速隐式表示或现有高斯溅射方法的非物理2D投影不同，nGRF执行直接3D电磁场聚合，每个高斯作为局部无线电调制器。

Result: 在室内场景中，nGRF比最先进方法实现10.9倍更高的预测SNR，推理延迟从242ms降至1.1ms(220倍加速)。在大规模室外环境中，nGRF达到26.2dB SNR。仅需每立方英尺0.011次测量，比现有方法(0.2-178.1)减少18倍数据收集负担。训练时间从小时级降至分钟级(180倍减少)。

Conclusion: nGRF框架通过3D高斯原语实现了高效准确的信道矩阵合成，显著解决了无线网络中的CSI估计瓶颈问题，在性能、效率和适应性方面都有突破性改进。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) remains the most critical bottleneck
in modern wireless networks, with pilot overhead consuming up to 11-21% of
transmission bandwidth, increasing latency by 20-40% in massive MIMO systems,
and reducing potential spectral efficiency by over 53%. Traditional estimation
techniques fundamentally fail under mobility, with feedback delays as small as
4 ms causing 50% throughput degradation at even modest speeds (30 km/h). We
present neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF), a novel framework that leverages
explicit 3D Gaussian primitives to synthesize complex channel matrices
accurately and efficiently. Unlike NeRF-based approaches that rely on slow
implicit representations or existing Gaussian splatting methods that use
non-physical 2D projections, nGRF performs direct 3D electromagnetic field
aggregation, with each Gaussian acting as a localized radio modulator. nGRF
demonstrates superior performance across diverse environments: in indoor
scenarios, it achieves a 10.9$\times$ higher prediction SNR than state of the
art methods while reducing inference latency from 242 ms to just 1.1 ms (a
220$\times$ speedup). For large-scale outdoor environments, where existing
approaches fail to function, nGRF achieves an SNR of 26.2 dB. Moreover, nGRF
requires only 0.011 measurements per cubic foot compared to 0.2-178.1 for
existing methods, thereby reducing data collection burden by 18$\times$.
Training time is similarly reduced from hours to minutes (a 180$\times$
reduction), enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic environments. The code and
datasets are available at: https://github.com/anonym-auth/n-grf

TL;DR: 通过年龄正则化的HRV特征提高了睡眠期间血糖预测的准确性，达到R2=0.161，比非正则化特征提高25.6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非侵入性血糖监测的关键挑战，特别是年龄相关自主神经变化对传统HRV分析的干扰

Method: 分析43名受试者的多模态数据，采用年龄正则化技术处理HRV特征，使用贝叶斯岭回归进行log-血糖预测

Result: 年龄正则化HRV特征完成R2=0.161（MAE=0.182），显著提高25.6%，最佳预测特征包括REM期和深睡期的年龄正则化HRV

Conclusion: 年龄正则化HRV特征显著提高了血糖预测准确性，为非侵入性监测提供了初步可行性，但需要更大规模的验证

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the
management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction
however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV
analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage
specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel
age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the
raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold
cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV
features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction,
representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The
top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p =
0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic
blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed
age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features
providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features
significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional
approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in
autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for
non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require
validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.

*BG Tong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这研究提出了一种新题的"功能-能量拓扑模型"，利用图神经网络从单通道EEG解码非自杀性自伤的脑网络模式，发现了关键的反馈循环失调机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是探索非自杀性自伤(NSSI)的神经动力学机制，并尝试从简化的单通道EEG数据中解码复杂的精神状态，以支持实际应用和数字疗法开发。

Method: 使用智能手机应用和便携式Fp1 EEG头带收集3名青少年NSSI患者近一个月的EEG数据，在冲动和非冲动状态下采集。构建了一个理论驱动的七节点图神经网络模型，通过内部训练(80/20分割)和留一中训练交叉验证评估性能，使用GNNExplainer进行可解释性分析。

Result: 模型在内部训练中达到了超过85%的准确率，跨主体表现也显著超过随机水平(约73.7%)。解释性分析发现了关键发现：在NSSI状态下，调节体感觉的关键反馈循环出现功能障碍和方向性反转，脑失去通过负面身体反馈进行自我纠正的能力，调节机制进入"无效空轮"状态。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了理论引导的图神经网络在稀疏单通道EEG数据上解码复杂精神状态的可行性。识别出的"反馈循环反转"提供了一种新题、动态且可计算的NSSI机制模型，为对象性生物标记物和下一代数字疗法开发铭平了道路。

Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel
"Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of
Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode
brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods:
EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a
smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and
non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was
built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for
interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%)
and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%).
Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical
feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional
reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via
negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective
idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying
theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental
states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and
computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers
and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).

explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's
composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict
corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the
input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and
compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest
regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing
ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR),
implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random
Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on
elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process
Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel
functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study
highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates
and material properties.

Motivation: 非标准BCG数据中J峰不显著导致心脏功能分析困难，需要有效方法来提升J峰检测的性能。

Method: 提出三种信号变换方法来改善短J现象和失K现象，在40名参与者的时间对齐ECG-BCG数据集上进行评估。

Result: 经过变换后的信号，仅使用局部极大值或极小值检测的简单J峰基础方法在定位J峰和提取BCG周期方面表现更好，尤其是对非标准BCG数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的信号变换方法能够有效改善非标准BCG信号的J峰显著性，提高心脏功能分析的准确性。

Abstract: Non-standard ballistocardiogram(BCG) data generally do not have prominent J
peaks. This paper introduces two phenomena that reduce the prominence of
Jpeaks: the shorter-J phenomenon and the lost-K phenomenon, both of which are
commonly observed in non-standard BCG signals . This paper also proposes three
signal transformation methods that effectively improve the lost-K and shorter-J
phenomena. The methods were evaluated on a time-aligned ECG-BCG dataset with 40
subjects. The results show that based on the transformed signal, simple
J-peak-based methods using only the detection of local maxima or minima show
better performance in locating J-peaks and extracting BCG cycles, especially
for non-standard BCG data.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle communications are encountering increasingly severe
multi-source interference challenges in dynamic adversarial environments, which
impose higher demands on their reliability and resilience. To address these
challenges, agent-based autonomous anti-jamming techniques have emerged as a
crucial research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that
first formalizes the concept of intelligent anti-jamming agents for UAV
communications and establishes a closed-loop decision-making framework centered
on the "Perception-Decision-Action" (P-D-A) paradigm. Within this framework, we
systematically review key technologies at each stage, with particular emphasis
on employing game theory to model UAV-jammer interactions and integrating
reinforcement learning-based intelligent algorithms to derive adaptive
anti-jamming strategies. Furthermore, we discuss potential limitations of
current approaches, identify critical engineering challenges, and outline
promising future research directions, aiming to provide valuable references for
developing more intelligent and robust anti-jamming communication systems for
UAVs.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了多种机器学习模型在跨被试脑电信号疼痛感知识别中的泛化性能，发现深度学习模型相比传统模型在跨被试场景下表现更稳健，图神经网络模型尤其展现出捕捉被试不变特征的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于EEG的疼痛感知研究面临跨被试泛化难题，由于脑电信号的高度个体差异性和现有研究对直接疼痛感知识别的关注有限，需要系统评估模型在跨被试场景下的性能。

Method: 使用108名被试的新型EEG数据集，系统评估包括传统分类器和深度神经网络在内的多种模型，在within-participant和cross-participant两种设置下进行性能基准测试。

Result: 传统模型在跨被试场景下性能下降最显著，深度学习模型表现出更好的稳健性，图神经网络模型展现出捕捉被试不变EEG信号结构的潜力，尽管性能变异性仍然较高。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型特别是图神经网络在跨被试EEG解码中具有优势，研究还提供了预处理数据集作为标准化基准，为未来算法在相同泛化约束下的评估提供支持。

Abstract: EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals
how the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious
stimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of
machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant
variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain
perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically
evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of
models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for
identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory
stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from
108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and
cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional
models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance,
while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential
for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability
remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its
potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other
hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a
standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same
generalization constraints.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习模型分析车轴转向机的电力信号模式，只需单一输入即可进行故障分类，达到极高准确度和可扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车轴转向机(PM)是关键路线设备，故障会导致服务中断。现有方法需要多种输入和特定信号处理，缺乏可扩展性。根据维护记录，主要故障原因包括障碍物、摩擦力、电源问题和对齐问题，这些问题会改变能消耗模式

Method: 仅需要单一的电力信号输入，应用深度学习模型分析车轴转向机运动过程中的电力信号模式，使用遵循预测(conformal prediction)提供系统输出的确定性指示

Result: 达到>99.99%的精确度，<0.01%的假正率，可忽略的假阿率。方法具有通用性和技术无关性，在真实世界和测试台环境中多种电机机械PM类型上验证了可扩展性

Conclusion: 该方法为预防性维护提供了高效解决方案，通过使用遵循预测技术为维护人员提供了清晰的确定性指示，使方法符合ISO-17359标准要求

Abstract: The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches
train routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical
safety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service
disruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary
interruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work
relies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.
This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,
but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and
operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance
records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source
issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern
of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM
movement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only
one input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to
classify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving
>99.99\% precision, <0.01\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our
methodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on
several electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench
environments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a
clear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence
layer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359
standard.

Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the
presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century
and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general
classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct
Current) and AC (Alternating Current) circuits. This work is focused on a
particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS),
designed with both high and low-frequency bands. This approach uses STDS
current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of
failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine
automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve
the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures
that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data
from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert
and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.

Motivation: 城市公园虽然可以缓解局部热岛效应，但现有的灌溉控制主要关注节水而非降温效果，需要开发智能灌溉系统来优化城市冷却。

Method: 部署202个土壤湿度传感器、50个温湿度节点和13个气象站，使用kNN算法进行短期滚动预测，结合异常检测和虚拟传感器技术处理设备故障。

Result: 平均绝对误差0.78%，优于SARIMA等复杂基线方法（P75误差0.71% vs 0.93%），系统已实现日常运行。

Conclusion: SIMPaCT提供了一个在城市公园尺度上实现稳健、冷却导向灌溉的操作方案，成功将智能灌溉与城市降温目标相结合。

Abstract: Urban parks can mitigate local heat, yet irrigation control is usually tuned
for water savings rather than cooling. We report on SIMPaCT (Smart Irrigation
Management for Parks and Cool Towns), a park-scale deployment that links
per-zone soil-moisture forecasts to overnight irrigation set-points in support
of urban cooling. SIMPaCT ingests data from 202 soil-moisture sensors, 50
temperature-relative humidity (TRH) nodes, and 13 weather stations, and trains
a per-sensor k-nearest neighbours (kNN) predictor on short rolling windows
(200-900h). A rule-first anomaly pipeline screens missing and stuck-at signals,
with model-based checks (Isolation Forest and ARIMA). When a device fails, a
mutual-information neighbourhood selects the most informative neighbour and a
small multilayer perceptron supplies a "virtual sensor" until restoration.
Across sensors the mean absolute error was 0.78%, comparable to more complex
baselines; the upper-quartile error (P75) was lower for kNN than SARIMA (0.71%
vs 0.93%). SIMPaCT runs daily and writes proposed set-points to the existing
controller for operator review. This short communication reports an operational
recipe for robust, cooling-oriented irrigation at city-park scale.

Abstract: We present an architecture for scaling digital beamforming for wideband
massive MIMO radar. Conventional spatial processing becomes computationally
prohibitive as array size grows; for example, the computational complexity of
MVDR beamforming scales as O(N^3) for an N-element array. In this paper, we
show that energy concentration in beamspace provides the basis for drastic
complexity reduction, with array scaling governed by the O(NlogN) complexity of
the spatial FFT used for beamspace transformation. Specifically, we propose an
architecture for windowed beamspace MVDR beamforming, parallelized across
targets and subbands, and evaluate its efficacy for beamforming and
interference suppression for government-supplied wideband radar data from the
DARPA SOAP (Scalable On-Array Processing) program. We demonstrate that our
approach achieves detection performance comparable to full-dimensional
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational and training overhead,
and provide insight into tradeoffs between beamspace window size and FFT
resolution in balancing complexity, detection accuracy, and interference
suppression.

Conclusion: 基站端DPoD技术是一种有效的解决方案，能够在不增加终端复杂性的前提下实现良好的非线性补偿效果，为5G系统的功耗优化提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In modern 5G user equipments (UEs), the power amplifier (PA) contributes
significantly to power consumption during uplink transmissions, especially in
cell-edge scenarios. While reducing power backoff can enhance PA efficiency, it
introduces nonlinear distortions that degrade signal quality. Existing
solutions, such as digital pre-distortion, require complex feedback mechanisms
for optimal performance, leading to increased UE complexity and power
consumption. Instead, in this study we explore digital post-distortion (DPoD)
techniques, which compensate for these distortions at the base station,
leveraging its superior computational resources. In this study, we conduct an
comprehensive study concerning the challenges and advantages associated with
applying DPoD in time-domain, frequency-domain, and DFT-s-domain. Our findings
suggest that implementing DPoD in the time-domain, complemented by
frequency-domain channel equalization, strikes a good balance between low
computational complexity and efficient nonlinearity compensation. In addition,
we demonstrate that memory has to be taken into account regardless of the
memory of the PA. Subsequently, we show how to pose the complex-valued problem
of nonlinearity compensation in a real Hilbert space, emphasizing the potential
performance enhancements as a result. We then discuss the traditional Volterra
series and show an equivalent kernel method that can reduce algorithmic
complexity. Simulations validate the results of our analysis and show that our
proposed algorithm can significantly improve performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Conclusion: 所提出的RSMA FBL传输方案有效满足URLLC要求，提升网络公平性，为下一代多址系统提供重要技术支撑

Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is a key technology for next-generation
multiple access systems due to its robustness against imperfect channel state
information (CSI). This makes RSMA particularly suitable for high-mobility
autonomous driving, where ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC)
is essential. To address the stringent requirements, this study enables RSMA
finite blocklength (FBL) transmissions and explicitly evaluates the ergodic
performance. We derive the closed-form lower bound for the ergodic sum-rate of
RSMA, considering vital factors such as the vehicle velocities, vehicle
positions, power allocation of each stream, blocklengths, and block error rates
(BLERs). To further enhance the ergodic sum-rate while complying with quality
of service (QoS) rate constraints, we jointly optimize the global power
coefficient, private power distribution, and common rate splitting. Guided by
gradient descent, we first adjust the global power coefficient based on its
sum-rate solution. This parameter regulates the power state of the common
stream, allowing for dynamic activation or deactivation: if active, we optimize
the private power distribution and adjust the common rate splitting to meet
minimum transmission constraints; if inactive, we use the sequential quadratic
programming for private power distribution optimization. Simulation results
confirm that our RSMA scheme significantly improves the ergodic performance,
reduces blocklength and BLER, surpassing the RSMA counterpart with average
private power and space division multiple access (SDMA). Furthermore, our
approach is validated to guarantee the rates for users with the poorest channel
conditions, thereby enhancing fairness across the network.

Conclusion: 研究成果对多维信号处理中的频率检测等应用具有重要意义，新条件在维度降为1时优于现有标量整数广义CRT的条件

Abstract: Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is widely applied in cryptography, coding
theory, and signal processing. It has been extended to the multidimensional CRT
(MD-CRT), which reconstructs an integer vector from its vector remainders
modulo multiple integer matrices. This paper investigates a generalized MD-CRT
for multiple integer vectors, where the goal is to determine multiple integer
vectors from multiple vector residue sets modulo multiple integer
matrices.Comparing to the existing generalized CRT for multiple scalar
integers, the challenge is that the moduli in MD-CRT are matrices that do not
commute and the corresponding uniquely determinable range is multidimensional
and the inclusion relationship is much more complicated. In this paper,we
address two fundamental questions regarding the generalized MD-CRT. The first
question concerns the uniquely determinable range of multiple integer vectors
when no prior information about them is available. The second question is about
the conditions under which the maximal possible dynamic range can be
achieved.To answer these two questions, we first derive a uniquely determinable
range without prior information and accordingly propose an algorithm to achieve
it. A special case involving only two integer vectors is investigated for the
second question, leading to a new condition for achieving the maximal possible
dynamic range. Interestingly, this newly obtained condition, when the dimension
is reduced to $1$, is even better than the existing ones for the conventional
generalized CRT for scalar integers.These results may have applications for
frequency detection in multidimensional signal processing.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-mounted simultaneous transmitting and
reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) systems can provide
full-dimensional coverage and flexible deployment opportunities in future
6G-enabled IoT networks. However, practical imperfections such as jittering and
airflow of UAV could affect the phase shift of STAR-RIS, and consequently
degrade network security. In this respect, this paper investigates the impact
of phase shift errors on the secrecy performance of UAV-mounted
STAR-RIS-assisted IoT systems. More specifically, we consider a UAV-mounted
STAR-RIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where IoT
devices are grouped into two groups: one group on each side of the STAR-RIS.
The nodes in each group are considered as potential Malicious nodes for the
ones on the other side. By modeling phase estimation errors using a von Mises
distribution, analytical closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates
under imperfect phase adjustment are derived. An optimization problem to
maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) by optimizing the UAV placement
is formulated and is then solved using a linear grid-based algorithm. Monte
Carlo simulations are provided to validate the analytical derivations. The
impact of phase estimation errors on system's secrecy performance is analyzed,
providing critical insights for the practical realisation of STAR-RIS
deployments for secure UAV-enabled IoT networks.

Abstract: Industry adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native wireless receivers,
or even modular, Machine Learning (ML)-aided wireless signal processing blocks,
has been slow. The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained
ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of
failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible
and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper
proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for
pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a
classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids
spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead,
it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific
configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and
validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver
model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's
Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel
delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of
AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our
proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19%
compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem,
demonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the
grid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making
it increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Precise localization of multi-agent systems (MAS) in harsh environments is a
critical challenge for swarm applications, and cooperative localization is
considered a key solution to this issue. Among all solutions, distributed
cooperative localization (DCL) has garnered widespread attention due to its
robustness and scalability. The main challenge of DCL lies in how to fuse
relative measurements between agents under unknown correlations. To address
this, covariance intersection (CI) was introduced to DCL. However, the
classical CI optimization criteria suffer from issues such as scale imbalance
and correlation mismatch during the fusion process. These deficiencies are not
as pronounced in 2D scenarios, where the state space is relatively simple and
the observability of each state component is well. However, in 3D scenarios,
where the state space is more complex and there are significant disparities in
the scale and observability of state components, performance degradation
becomes severe. This necessitates the design of specialized mechanisms to
improve the data fusion process. In this paper, we identify three main
drawbacks of the classical CI optimization criteria in recursive filtering and
introduce a weighting mechanism, namely weighted covariance intersection (WCI),
to improve its performance. We then introduce WCI into range-based distributed
cooperative localization in 3D scenarios, developing a concurrent fusion
strategy for multiple distance measurements and designing a weighting matrix
based on the error propagation rule of the inertial navigation system (INS).
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed WCI significantly enhances
cooperative localization performance compared to classical CI, while the
distributed approach outperforms the centralized approach in terms of
robustness, scalability, and is more suitable for large-scale swarms.

Abstract: As a critical component of Wearable AI, IMU-based Human Activity Recognition
(HAR) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in
recent years. Although HAR performance has improved considerably in specific
scenarios, its generalization capability remains a key barrier to widespread
real-world adoption. For example, domain shifts caused by variations in users,
sensor positions, or environments can significantly decrease the performance in
practice. As a result, in this survey, we explore the rapidly evolving field of
IMU-based generalizable HAR, reviewing 229 research papers alongside 25
publicly available datasets to provide a broad and insightful overview. We
first present the background and overall framework of IMU-based HAR tasks, as
well as the generalization-oriented training settings. Then, we categorize
representative methodologies from two perspectives: (i) model-centric
approaches, including pre-training method, end-to-end method, and large
language model (LLM)-based learning method; and (ii) data-centric approaches,
including multi-modal learning and data augmentation techniques. In addition,
we summarize widely used datasets in this field, as well as relevant tools and
benchmarks. Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability
of IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent
challenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation)
and also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of
foundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware
reasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于符号级预编码(SLP)的AFDM传输框架，通过将下行处理负担转移到基站来降低接收端计算复杂度，并使用SBL算法进行上行通道估计。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了AFDM高接收端复杂度问题，验证了方案的实用性，为AFDM的实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has attracted considerable
attention for its robustness to Doppler effects. However, its high
receiver-side computational complexity remains a major barrier to practical
deployment. To address this, we propose a novel symbol-level precoding
(SLP)-based AFDM transmission framework, which shifts the signal processing
burden in downlink communications from user side to the base station (BS),
enabling direct symbol detection without requiring channel estimation or
equalization at the receiver. Specifically, in the uplink phase, we propose a
Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) based channel estimation algorithm by exploiting
the inherent sparsity of affine frequency (AF) domain channels. In particular,
the sparse prior is modeled via a hierarchical Laplace distribution, and
parameters are iteratively updated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm. We also derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) to characterize
the theoretical performance limit. In the downlink phase, the BS employs the
SLP technology to design the transmitted waveform based on the estimated uplink
channel state information (CSI) and channel reciprocity. The resulting
optimization problem is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP)
problem, and its dual problem is investigated by Lagrangian function and
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
SBL estimator outperforms traditional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) in
accuracy and robustness to off-grid effects, while the SLP-based waveform
design scheme achieves performance comparable to conventional AFDM receivers
while significantly reducing the computational complexity at receiver,
validating the practicality of our approach.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了极化可重构大规模MIMO系统中的导频开销问题，并通过模型可解释性分析了学习能力

Abstract: Recent advancement in next generation reconfigurable antenna and fluid
antenna technology has influenced the wireless system with polarization
reconfigurable (PR) channels to attract significant attention for promoting
beneficial channel condition. We exploit the benefit of PR antennas by
integrating such technology into massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
system. In particular, we aim to jointly design the polarization and
beamforming vectors on both transceivers for simultaneous channel
reconfiguration and beam alignment, which remarkably enhance the beamforming
gain. However, joint optimization over polarization and beamforming vectors
without channel state information (CSI) is a challenging task, since
depolarization increases the channel dimension; whereas massive MIMO systems
typically have low-dimensional pilot measurement from limited radio frequency
(RF) chain. This leads to pilot overhead because the transceivers can only
observe low-dimensional measurement of the high-dimension channel. This paper
pursues the reduction of the pilot overhead in such systems by proposing to
employ \emph{interpretable transformer}-based deep learning framework on both
transceivers to actively design the polarization and beamforming vectors for
pilot stage and transmission stage based on the sequence of accumulated
received pilots. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant performance
gain of our proposed framework over the existing non-adaptive and active
data-driven methods. Furthermore, we exploit the interpretability of our
proposed framework to analyze the learning capabilities of the model.

Conclusion: 所提出的差分变压器框架有效提升了无线干扰识别系统对抗对抗样本攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Wireless jamming identification, which detects and classifies electromagnetic
jamming from non-cooperative devices, is crucial for emerging low-altitude
wireless networks consisting of many drone terminals that are highly
susceptible to electromagnetic jamming. However, jamming identification schemes
adopting deep learning (DL) are vulnerable to attacks involving carefully
crafted adversarial samples, resulting in inevitable robustness degradation. To
address this issue, we propose a differential transformer framework for
wireless jamming identification. Firstly, we introduce a differential
transformer network in order to distinguish jamming signals, which overcomes
the attention noise when compared with its traditional counterpart by
performing self-attention operations in a differential manner. Secondly, we
propose a randomized masking training strategy to improve network robustness,
which leverages the patch partitioning mechanism inherent to transformer
architectures in order to create parallel feature extraction branches. Each
branch operates on a distinct, randomly masked subset of patches, which
fundamentally constrains the propagation of adversarial perturbations across
the network. Additionally, the ensemble effect generated by fusing predictions
from these diverse branches demonstrates superior resilience against
adversarial attacks. Finally, we introduce a novel consistent training
framework that significantly enhances adversarial robustness through dualbranch
regularization. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methodology is
superior to existing methods in boosting robustness to adversarial samples.

Method: 提出基于MUSIC和最小二乘法的空间信号分离方法来分离不同目标的回波信号，以及基于相干补偿的感知信号处理方法来提升OFDM块的SINR。

Result: 模拟结果显示，与传统二维快速富里变换方法相比，新方法在500米远距离目标上将RDM的SINR提高了10dB，检测概率也显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ISAC系统中OFDM信号的相干前缀限制问题，显著提升了远距离目标检测的性能，为6G集成感知与通信技术提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising candidate
technology for 6G due to its improvement in spectral efficiency and energy
efficiency. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a
mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol
interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip
delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits
the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target,
the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo's
power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the
above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares
(LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo
signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent
compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed
to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM
block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation
results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10
dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform
(2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly
improved compared to the benchmarking method.

Result: 模拟实验确认，在设计阶段考虑传感器方向性能够在不同频率、不同数组布局和噪声条件下获得准确且稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的幻模匹配框架有效解决了形成数组中传感器方向性导致的性能问题，实现了广带宽频率不变的空间响应，为小型数组的应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Small-size acoustic arrays exploit spatial diversity to achieve capabilities
beyond those of single-element devices, with applications ranging from
teleconferencing to immersive multimedia. A key requirement for broadband array
processing is a frequency-invariant spatial response, which ensures consistent
directivity across wide bandwidths and prevents spectral coloration.
Differential beamforming offers an inherently frequency-invariant solution by
leveraging pressure differences between closely spaced elements of small-size
arrays. Traditional approaches, however, assume the array elements to be
omnidirectional, whereas real transducers exhibit frequency-dependent
directivity that can degrade performance if not properly modeled. To address
this limitation, we propose a generalized modal matching framework for
frequency-invariant differential beamforming, applicable to unconstrained
planar arrays of first-order directional elements. By representing the desired
beampattern as a truncated circular harmonic expansion and fitting it to the
actual element responses, our method accommodates arbitrary planar geometries
and element orientations. This approach enables the synthesis of beampatterns
of any order and steering direction without imposing rigid layout requirements.
Simulations confirm that accounting for sensor directivity at the design stage
yields accurate and robust performance across varying frequencies, geometries,
and noise conditions.

TL;DR: WiDFS 3.0是一个轻量级双基地SISO感知框架，通过自参考互相关方法和延迟域波束成形技术，解决了单天线收发器中的时钟异步问题，实现了准确的延迟和多普勒估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线系统中的集成感知与通信(ISAC)在实际部署中往往受限于低成本单天线收发器。在双基地SISO设置中，时钟异步会在信道状态信息(CSI)中引入随机相位偏移，传统多天线方法无法解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需单天线收发器，适合低复杂度部署，在嵌入式友好的MobileViT-XXS模型上仅需130万参数就能持续优于传统特征方法。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless systems. However, real-world deployment is often
limited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in
Channel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional
multi-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic
SISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from
distorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It
operates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver,
making it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a
self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal
and employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity. The resulting
unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact
neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate
parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of
prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under
single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features
show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on
the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0
consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored
Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler.

Abstract: In response to the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
rising security risks, Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) has become key for
device identification and authentication. However, various changing factors -
beyond the RFF itself - can be entangled from signal transmission to reception,
reducing the effectiveness of RFF Identification (RFFI). Existing RFFI methods
mainly rely on domain adaptation techniques, which often lack explicit factor
representations, resulting in less robustness and limited controllability for
downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Disentangled
Representation Learning (DRL) framework that learns explicit and independent
representations of multiple factors, including the RFF. Our framework
introduces modules for disentanglement, guided by the principles of
explicitness, modularity, and compactness. We design two dedicated modules for
factor classification and signal reconstruction, each with tailored loss
functions that encourage effective disentanglement and enhance support for
downstream tasks. Thus, the framework can extract a set of interpretable
vectors that explicitly represent corresponding factors. We evaluate our
approach on two public benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset. Our
method achieves impressive performance on multiple DRL metrics. We also analyze
the effectiveness of our method on downstream RFFI task and conditional signal
generation task. All modules of the framework contribute to improved
classification accuracy, and enable precise control over conditional generated
signals. These results highlight the potential of our DRL framework for
interpretable and explicit RFFs.

Abstract: 5G-Advanced (5G-A) has enabled the vibrant development of low altitude
integrated sensing and communication (LA-ISAC) networks. As a core component of
these networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have witnessed rapid growth in
recent years. However, due to the lag in traditional industry regulatory norms,
unauthorized flight incidents occur frequently, posing a severe security threat
to LA-ISAC networks. To surveil the non-cooperative UAVs, in this paper, we
propose a multi-domain supervised contrastive learning (MD-SupContrast)
framework for UAV radio frequency (RF) open-set recognition. Specifically,
first, the texture features and the time-frequency position features from the
ResNet and the TransformerEncoder are fused, and then the supervised
contrastive learning is applied to optimize the feature representation of the
closed-set samples. Next, to surveil the invasive UAVs that appear in real
life, we propose an improved generative OpenMax (IG-OpenMax) algorithm and
construct an open-set recognition model, namely Open-RFNet. According to the
unknown samples, we first freeze the feature extraction layers and then only
retrain the classification layer, which achieves excellent recognition
performance both in closed-set and open-set recognitions. We analyze the
computational complexity of the proposed model. Experiments are conducted with
a large-scale UAV open dataset. The results show that the proposed Open-RFNet
outperforms the existing benchmark methods in terms of recognition accuracy
between the known and the unknown UAVs, as it achieves 95.12% in closed-set and
96.08% in open-set under 25 UAV types, respectively.

Abstract: The evolution of 6G networks demands ultra-massive connectivity and
intelligent radio environments, yet existing reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS) technologies face critical limitations in hardware efficiency, dynamic
control, and scalability. This paper introduces LLM-RIMSA, a transformative
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with a novel
reconfigurable intelligent metasurface antenna (RIMSA) architecture to address
these challenges. Unlike conventional RIS designs, RIMSA employs parallel
coaxial feeding and 2D metasurface integration, enabling each individual
metamaterial element to independently adjust both its amplitude and phase.
While traditional optimization and deep learning (DL) methods struggle with
high-dimensional state spaces and prohibitive training costs for RIMSA control,
LLM-RIMSA leverages pre-trained LLMs cross-modal reasoning and few-shot
learning capabilities to dynamically optimize RIMSA configurations. Simulations
demonstrate that LLM-RIMSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
conventional DL-based methods in sum rate while reducing training overhead. The
proposed framework pave the way for LLM-driven intelligent radio environments.

Abstract: Accurate and high precision of the indoor positioning is as important as
ensuring reliable navigation in outdoor environments. Using the
state-of-the-art deep learning models provides better reliability and accuracy
to navigate and monitor the accurate positions in the aircraft cabin
environment. We utilize the simulated aircraft cabin environment measurements
and propose a residual neural network (ResNet) model to predict the accurate
positions inside the cabin. The measurements include the ranges and angles
between a tag and the anchors points which are then mapped onto a grid as range
and angle residuals. These residual maps are then transformed into the
likelihood grid maps where each cell of the grid shows the likelihood of being
a true location. These grid maps along with the true positions are then passed
as inputs to train the ResNet model. Since any deep learning model involve
numerous parameter settings, hyperparameter optimization is performed to get
the optimal parameters for training the model effectively with the highest
accuracy. Once we get the best hyperparameters settings of the model, it is
then trained to predict the positions which provides a centimeter-level
accuracy of the localization.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence approaches for base-band processing for radio
receivers have demonstrated significant performance gains. Most of the proposed
methods are characterized by high compute and memory requirements, hindering
their deployment at the edge of the Radio Access Networks (RAN) and limiting
their scalability to large bandwidths and many antenna 6G systems. In this
paper, we propose a low-complexity, model-driven neural network-based receiver,
designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems and
suitable for implementation at the RAN edge. The proposed solution is compliant
with the 5G New Radio (5G NR), and supports different modulation schemes,
bandwidths, number of users, and number of base-station antennas with a single
trained model without the need for further training. Numerical simulations of
the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) processing show that the proposed
solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of achievable
Transport Block Error Rate (TBLER), while reducing the Floating Point
Operations (FLOPs) by 66$\times$, and the learnable parameters by 396$\times$.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了无人机遥控链路中的干扰不对称问题，通过实际测量和模拟验证了上行链路干扰导致HARQ反馈丢失，从而严重降低下行速率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机遥控链路的可靠性和安全性至关重要，但无人机围缘的干扰源更多，导致上行链路干扰不对称，会丢失HARQ指示符反馈，影响下行速率。

Method: 首先在NC State大学主校区通过氮气球平台进行实际测量，然后使用MATLAB的LTE和5G工具箱模拟评估HARQ指示符反馈丢失对速率的影响。

Result: 数值结果证实上行链路干扰不对称会导致HARQ指示符反馈丢失，从而对下行速率性能造成显著降低。

Conclusion: 无人机遥控系统存在显著的上行链路干扰不对称问题，这种不对称性会通过影响HARQ反馈机制严重造成下行速率性能的劣化。

Abstract: Reliable and secure connectivity is crucial for remote control (RC) and
uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) links. A major problem for UAV RC links is that
interference sources within the coverage may degrade the link quality. Such
interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV than the RC unit on the
ground due to the UAV being in line of sight (LoS) with a larger number of
interference sources. As a result, lost hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)
indicators (ACK/NACK) feedback in the uplink (UL, RC to UAV) may degrade the
downlink (DL, UAV to RC) throughput. To get physical evidence for our
interference asymmetry argument, we first conducted a measurement campaign
using a helikite platform at the Main Campus area of NC State University during
the 2024 Packapalooza festival. Subsequently, we evaluated the throughput
impact of the loss of HARQ indicator feedback caused by UL asymmetry using
MATLAB long-term-evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G) toolboxes. Our
numerical results confirm that UL interference asymmetry substantially degrades
the throughput performance due to the loss of HARQ indicator feedback.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于卷积神经网络的新题检测器，通过结构化固定内核层和域知识遮罩技术，有效减轻FTN信号中的码间干扰，在保持计算效率的同时实现接近最优的比特错误率性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN检测器使用移动内核方式，无法显式学习不同距离处的码间干扰模式，导致计算重复和性能次优。需要一种更有效的方法来处理FTN信号中的复杂ISI问题。

Method: 采用结构化固定卷积内核层，在预定义位置显式学习不同距离处的ISI模式。使用域知识遮罩提高特征提取效果。采用层次滤波器分配策略，在前期层分配更多滤波器来处理更强的ISI分量。

Result: 在压缩因子τ≥0.7时，实现了接近BCJR算法的最优BER性能，同时计算成本比M-BCJR减少了46%（BPSK）和84%（QPSK）。方法适用于高阶调制（64-QAM），在几乎静止多路滞尤衰落频道中保持稳健性，并在LDPC编码FTN传输中有效。

Conclusion: 该结构化CNN检测器通过显式学习ISI模式，在保持计算效率的同时实现了接近最优的检测性能，显示了在实际FTN通信系统中的强大适用性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detector
for faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, introducing structured fixed kernel
layers with domain-informed masking to effectively mitigate intersymbol
interference (ISI). Unlike standard CNN architectures that rely on moving
kernels, the proposed approach employs fixed convolutional kernels at
predefined positions to explicitly learn ISI patterns at varying distances from
the central symbol. To enhance feature extraction, a hierarchical filter
allocation strategy is employed, assigning more filters to earlier layers for
stronger ISI components and fewer to later layers for weaker components. This
structured design improves feature representation, eliminates redundant
computations, and enhances detection accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves
near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance, comparable to the BCJR algorithm
for the compression factor $\tau \geq 0.7$, while offering up to $46\%$ and
$84\%$ computational cost reduction over M-BCJR for BPSK and QPSK,
respectively. Additional evaluations confirm the method's adaptability to
high-order modulations (up to 64-QAM), resilience in quasi-static multipath
Rayleigh fading channels, and effectiveness under LDPC-coded FTN transmission,
highlighting its robustness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声成像算法在形态异质性对象（如超重或肥胖患者）中表现不佳，因为波束形成过程未考虑声速的空间变化。虽然可以通过补充校正来解决，但会增加计算复杂度。

Method: 扩展了波场相关成像（WCI）方法，使其能够处理任意已知的声速分布，直接在图像形成过程中整合异质性信息，开发了异质波场相关成像（HWCI）技术。

Conclusion: 异质波场相关成像（HWCI）具有很高的转化潜力，能够显著提高超声图像的客观质量，从而提升临床实用性。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is an indispensable tool for diagnostic imaging,
particularly given its cost, safety, and portability profiles compared to other
modalities. However, US is challenged in subjects with morphological
heterogeneity (e.g., those with overweight or obesity), largely because
conventional imaging algorithms do not account for such variation in the
beamforming process. Specific knowledge of the these spatial variations enables
supplemental corrections of these algorithms, but with added computational
complexity. Wavefield correlation imaging (WCI) enables efficient image
formation in the spatial frequency domain that, in its canonical formulation,
assumes a uniform medium. In this work, we present an extension of WCI to
arbitrary known speed-of-sound distributions directly in the image formation
process, and demonstrate its feasibility in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. We
report resolution improvements of over 30% and contrast improvements of order
10% over conventional WCI imaging. Together our results suggest heterogeneous
WCI (HWCI) may have high translational potential to improve the objective
quality, and thus clinical utility, of ultrasound images.

Conclusion: 该方法特别适合具有多径干扰和硬件限制的实际毫米波部署环境，实现了低复杂度硬件下的高速高精度DOA估计

Abstract: A novel approach combining agile beam switching with deep learning to enhance
the speed and accuracy of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for
millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased array systems with low-complexity hardware
implementations is proposed and evaluated. Traditional DOA methods requiring
direct access to individual antenna elements are impractical for analog or
hybrid beamforming systems prevalent in modern mmWave implementations. Recent
agile beam switching techniques have demonstrated rapid DOA estimation, but
their accuracy and robustness can be further improved via deep learning.
BeamSeek addresses these limitations by employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and specialized data augmentation that emulates real-world propagation
conditions. The proposed approach was experimentally validated at 60 GHz using
the NSF PAWR COSMOS testbed, demonstrating significant improvements over a
correlation-based method across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.
Results show that BeamSeek achieves up to an 8 degree reduction in average
estimation error compared to this baseline, with particular advantages in noisy
channels. This makes it especially suitable for practical mmWave deployments in
environments characterized by multipath interference and hardware constraints.

Conclusion: 所提算法性能随新导频污染指标单调下降，为通过迭代联合检测算法理解和管控导频污染提供了有价值的理论和实践工具

Abstract: Pilot contamination (PC) arises when the pilot sequences assigned to user
equipments (UEs) are not mutually orthogonal, eventually due to their reuse. In
this work, we propose a novel expectation propagation (EP)-based joint channel
estimation and data detection (JCD) algorithm specifically designed to mitigate
the effects of PC in the uplink of cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-MaMIMO) systems. This modified bilinear-EP algorithm is
distributed, scalable, demonstrates strong robustness to PC, and outperforms
state-of-the-art Bayesian learning algorithms. Through a comprehensive
performance evaluation, we assess the performance of Bayesian learning
algorithms for different pilot sequences and observe that the use of
non-orthogonal pilots can lead to better performance compared to shared
orthogonal sequences. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce a new metric to
quantify PC at the UE level. We show that the performance of the considered
algorithms degrades monotonically with respect to this metric, providing a
valuable theoretical and practical tool for understanding and managing PC via
iterative JCD algorithms.

Motivation: 复杂系统普遍表现出涌现现象，但长期以来缺乏预测这一过程的定量定律。研究旨在建立并验证一个能够识别涌现自然尺度的可证伪的第一性原理定律。

Method: 定义系统在空间尺度ℓ上的因果力为有效信息EI_ℓ，通过最大熵干预与其结果之间的互信息来测量。推导并证明了中尺度峰值定理，并在2D伊辛模型和基于agent的集体行为模型中提供定量、可重复的证据。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了一个可证伪的第一性原理定律，能够识别涌现的自然尺度，为有效理论的发现提供了定量基础，解决了复杂系统研究中长期存在的关键问题。

Abstract: Complex systems universally exhibit emergence, where macroscopic dynamics
arise from local interactions, but a predictive law governing this process has
been absent. We establish and verify such a law. We define a system's causal
power at a spatial scale, $\ell$, as its Effective Information (EI$_\ell$),
measured by the mutual information between a targeted, maximum-entropy
intervention and its outcome. From this, we derive and prove a Middle-Scale
Peak Theorem: for a broad class of systems with local interactions, EI$_\ell$
is not monotonic but exhibits a strict maximum at a mesoscopic scale $\ell^*$.
This peak is a necessary consequence of a fundamental trade-off between
noise-averaging at small scales and locality-limited response at large scales.
We provide quantitative, reproducible evidence for this law in two distinct
domains: a 2D Ising model near criticality and a model of agent-based
collective behavior. In both systems, the predicted unimodal peak is decisively
confirmed by statistical model selection. Our work establishes a falsifiable,
first-principles law that identifies the natural scale of emergence, providing
a quantitative foundation for the discovery of effective theories.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), recognized as a critical enabler
for 6G networks, exhibit unprecedented capabilities in electromagnetic wave
manipulation and wireless channel reconfiguration. By leveraging existing
network infrastructure, RIS can cost-effectively create signal hotspots in
low-altitude environments, ensuring robust connectivity to support the
sustainable development of the low-altitude economy. However, achieving optimal
phase shift design in multi-user scenarios faces two major challenges: the
high-dimensional optimization introduced by massive RIS elements, and the
persistent coupling of multi-user signals caused by shared RIS reflections.
This paper utilize the visible region of an RIS arranged as the uniform
cylindrical array (UCA) to reduce the complexity of phase shift design. Under
the UCA architecture, RIS elements are categorized into two types:
user-specific units and multi-user shared units. We then determine the optimal
phase shifts by iteratively optimizing the phase shifts of multi-user shared
units while directly configuring those of user-specific units based on a
derived closed-form solution. The proposed approach significantly reduces
optimization complexity, which is further corroborated by numerical simulation
results demonstrating its substantial impact on both system performance and
computational efficiency compared to the conventional RIS with uniform planar
array.

Abstract: Semantic communication is emerging as an effective means of facilitating
intelligent and context-aware communication for next-generation communication
systems. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called Age of Incorrect
Semantics (AoIS) for the transmission of video frames over multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) channels in a monitoring system. Different from the
conventional age-based approaches, we jointly consider the information
freshness and the semantic importance, and then formulate a time-averaged AoIS
minimization problem by jointly optimizing the semantic actuation indicator,
transceiver beamformer, and the semantic symbol design. We first transform the
original problem into a low-complexity problem via the Lyapunov optimization.
Then, we decompose the transformed problem into multiple subproblems and adopt
the alternative optimization (AO) method to solve each subproblem.
Specifically, we propose two efficient algorithms, i.e., the successive convex
approximation (SCA) algorithm and the low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)
algorithm for optimizing transceiver beamformer. We adopt exhaustive search
methods to solve the semantic actuation policy indicator optimization problem
and the transmitted semantic symbol design problem. Experimental results
demonstrate that our scheme can preserve more than 50\% of the original
information under the same AoIS compared to the constrained baselines.

Abstract: Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes are a well-studied family of codes, known for
achieving list decoding capacity. In this work, we give improved deterministic

$1-R-\varepsilon$.
  We present a deterministic decoder that runs in near-linear time

$n^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$ for decoding FRS codes. Prior to our work, no
capacity achieving code was known whose deterministic decoding could be done in
time $\widetilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n)$.
  We also present a randomized decoder that runs in fully polynomial time
$\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon) \cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$, improving the best-known
runtime $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)\cdot \widetilde{O}(n)$ for decoding FRS
codes. Again, prior to our work, no capacity achieving code was known whose
decoding time depended polynomially on $1/\varepsilon$.

Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift
from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more
efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep
learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers
classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We
adopt ResNets-based models and evaluate them on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets to simulate real-world classification tasks in wireless environments.
We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a
wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted
semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task
accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with
appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can
retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both
computational load and communication overhead.

Abstract: In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair
representation that attains bounded statistical (demographic) parity. More
specifically, an agent uses some useful data $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since
both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some sensitive attribute or secret $S$,
the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded statistical
parity and/or privacy leakage constraint, that is, such that $I(Y;S) \leq
\epsilon$. Here, we relax the perfect demographic (statistical) parity and
consider a bounded-parity constraint. In this work, we design the
representation $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the
task while satisfying a bounded compression (or encoding rate) constraint, that
is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \leq r$. Simultaneously, $Y$ satisfies the bounded
statistical parity constraint $I(Y;S) \leq \epsilon$. To design $Y$, we use
extended versions of the Functional Representation Lemma and the Strong
Functional Representation Lemma which are based on randomization techniques and
study the tightness of the obtained bounds in special cases. The main idea to
derive the lower bounds is to use randomization over useful data $X$ or
sensitive data $S$. Considering perfect demographic parity, i.e., $\epsilon=0$,
we improve the existing results (lower bounds) by using a tighter version of
the Strong Functional Representation Lemma and propose new upper bounds. We
then propose upper and lower bounds for the main problem and show that allowing
non-zero leakage can improve the attained utility. Finally, we study the bounds
and compare them in a numerical example. The problem studied in this paper can
also be interpreted as one of code design with bounded leakage and bounded rate
privacy considering the sensitive attribute as a secret.

Abstract: Joint radar-communications (JRC) technology has attracted massive attention
for decades, since it can effectively utilize allocated spectral resources by
sharing frequency bands in increasingly crowded environments. In addition, the
growing demand for hardware platform sharing which benefits both
functionalities motivates more cooperation between radar and communication
systems. In order to achieve the coexistence of sensing and communicating
operations, joint systems should be designed to perform both tasks
simultaneously. Developing a joint radar-communications waveform which is
suitable for both functions is extremely crucial for this type of co-design, as
it not only decreases spectral impact, but also benefits performances of both
systems mutually. In this paper, a joint radar-communications waveform is
utilized to perform GEO SA-Bi SAR imaging and wireless communication
simultaneously. We also design a joint radar-communications receiver in this
context to demonstrate feasibility of achieving both sensing and signaling with
GEO SA-Bi SAR system.

Result: 在20个数据集上持续超越最先进模型，在恶性肿瘤分类、疾病严重程度分级、多类别诊断和图像描述等高级任务表现出色，在病变分割等低级任务也达到最佳性能。在隐私保护联邦学习场景和不同肤色性别中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DermNIO通过创新的混合预训练方法有效解决了皮肤科AI模型的局限性，显著提升了泛化能力和临床实用性，有望缓解全球皮肤科医疗资源短缺问题。

Abstract: Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems,
driven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population),
complex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in
resource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have
demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face
limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built
for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings.
To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model
for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three
sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections),
DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the
self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and
knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only
deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also
substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical
tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level
clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity
grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also
achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion
segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in
privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types
and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved
95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance
improved clinician performance by 17.21%.

*Shayan Kebriti,Shahabedin Nabavi,Ali Gooya*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FractMorph是一个基于3D双并行Transformer的新型可变形图像配准架构，通过多域分数傅里叶变换分支增强跨图像特征匹配，在ACDC心脏MRI数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在统一框架中同时捕捉细粒度局部变形和大尺度全局变形，需要一种能够同时处理多尺度特征的有效配准方法。

Method: 采用双并行Transformer架构，每个分数交叉注意力块在0°、45°、90°分数角度并行应用分数傅里叶变换，配合对数幅度分支同时提取局部、半全局和全局特征，通过交叉注意力融合固定和移动图像流特征，最后通过轻量级U-Net网络预测密集变形场。

Result: 在ACDC心脏MRI数据集上达到整体Dice相似系数86.45%，平均每结构DSC 75.15%，95% Hausdorff距离1.54mm。轻量版FractMorph-Light仅29.6M参数，保持相似精度但内存使用减半。

Conclusion: 多域谱空间注意力Transformer能够通过单一端到端网络稳健高效地建模医学图像中的复杂非刚性变形，无需场景特定调优或多尺度层次网络。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial and challenging technique
for aligning anatomical structures in medical images and is widely applied in
diverse clinical applications. However, existing approaches often struggle to
capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations
simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D
dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature
matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches.
Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at
fractional angles of 0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, along with a log-magnitude
branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the
same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between the fixed and
moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then predicts a dense
deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On the ACDC cardiac
MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.45%, an average per-structure DSC of
75.15%, and a 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 1.54 mm on our data
split. We also introduce FractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model
with only 29.6M parameters, which maintains the superior accuracy of the main
model while using approximately half the memory. Our results demonstrate that
multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and
efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a
single end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or
hierarchical multi-scale networks. The source code of our implementation is
available at https://github.com/shayankebriti/FractMorph.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了多种MRI对比度输入对丘脑核团分割的效果，发现T1映射单独使用即可获得最佳性能，而PD映射没有额外价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 丘脑核团的精确分割对理解神经系统疾病和指导临床干预至关重要，但最佳的分割输入仍然不明确。

Method: 使用3D U-Net模型，系统评估MPRAGE、FGATIR序列、定量PD和T1映射以及多反转时间的T1加权图像。对多TI图像采用基于梯度的显著性分析和蒙特卡洛dropout来筛选最重要图像。

Result: T1映射单独使用就能实现强大的定量性能和优越的定性结果，PD映射没有提供额外价值。

Conclusion: T1映射是丘脑核团分割中最可靠和高效的输入选择，为优化成像协议提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation is crucial for understanding
neurological diseases, brain functions, and guiding clinical interventions.
However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study
systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR
sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at
different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs.
For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte
Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images
contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these
configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative
performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added
value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and
efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for
optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or
research interest.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种利用原始图像和结构压制变体的融合特征的肺结节钙化分类模型，用于提高胸部X光片中肺结节钙化识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺结节钙化是良性结节的关键指标，但临床实践中主要依靠医生视觉评估，存在显著的解释差异。肌骨、脊柱等重叠解剖结构也增加了钙化模式识别的难度。

Method: 研究提出了一种钙化分类模型，通过融合原始图像和结构压制变体的特征来减少结构干扰。使用了来自Ajou大学医院的2,517张无痕痕图像和656张结节图像（包括151个钙化结节和550个非钙化结节）进行训练。

Result: 建议模型在钙化诊断中达到了86.52%的准确率和0.8889的AUC值，远超仅使用原始图像训练的模型（分别提高3.54%和0.0385）。

Conclusion: 该研究开发的钙化分类模型通过融合结构压制特征，显著提高了胸部X光片中肺结节钙化识别的准确性，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of pulmonary nodules on chest X-rays can
differentiate between life-saving early treatment and avoidable invasive
procedures. Calcification is a definitive indicator of benign nodules and is
the primary foundation for diagnosis. In actual practice, diagnosing pulmonary
nodule calcification on chest X-rays predominantly depends on the physician's
visual assessment, resulting in significant diversity in interpretation.
Furthermore, overlapping anatomical elements, such as ribs and spine,
complicate the precise identification of calcification patterns. This study
presents a calcification classification model that attains strong diagnostic
performance by utilizing fused features derived from raw images and their
structure-suppressed variants to reduce structural interference. We used 2,517
lesion-free images and 656 nodule images (151 calcified nodules and 550
non-calcified nodules), all obtained from Ajou University Hospital. The
suggested model attained an accuracy of 86.52% and an AUC of 0.8889 in
calcification diagnosis, surpassing the model trained on raw images by 3.54%
and 0.0385, respectively.

Motivation: 解决在工业检测和医学影像领域中，标签获取成本高或不想引入异常类型偏差的问题，需要一种只需正常数据训练的无监督异常检测方法

Method: 提出了一种结构化嵌入比较计量方法，结合特征成本和空间成本，利用最优运输从预训练图像编码器提取的拓展表示中学习局部和全局原型

Result: 方法能够强化结构约束学习原型，抓取正常样本的基础组织结构，改善图像中不一致性的检测能力，在两个工业图像异常检测标准测试集上达到了与强势基线相当的性能

Conclusion: 该研究提出的原型学习结合最优运输的无监督异常检测方法有效地检测工业图像中的缺陷，为标签资源稀缺或不想引入偏差的应用场景提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by
having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It
has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical
imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing
biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a
novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare
a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a
spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global
prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a
pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a
structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the
underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of
incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with
strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on
industrial images. The code is available at

TL;DR: 通过使用小型适配器和限量真实TEE数据，将TTE训练的模型适配到TEE预测任务，实现高保真度图像生成和提升下游分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TEE数据缺乏领域中深度模型训练困难的问题，TEE模态数据严重不足限制了深度学习在这个高影响模态中的应用

Method: 采用低秩适配(LoRA)结合MaskR$^2$轻量级重映层，将TTE训练的掩码条件泄散模型适配到TEE任务，仅需$10^5$参数和少量新案例

Result: 仅适配MLP层即可实现高保真度TEE生成，混合少于200弹真实TEE帧根据后显著提升多类分割任务的dice分数，尤其在不充分代表的右心结构上

Conclusion: 证明了语义控制TEE图像可以以低开销生成，MaskR$^2$能够有效转换未见控制格式而不损害下游任务性能，生成的图像对提升多类分割任务有效

Abstract: Deep diffusion models excel at realistic image synthesis but demand large
training sets-an obstacle in data-scarce domains like transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE). While synthetic augmentation has boosted performance in
transthoracic echo (TTE), TEE remains critically underrepresented, limiting the
reach of deep learning in this high-impact modality.
  We address this gap by adapting a TTE-trained, mask-conditioned diffusion
backbone to TEE with only a limited number of new cases and adapters as small
as $10^5$ parameters. Our pipeline combines Low-Rank Adaptation with MaskR$^2$,
a lightweight remapping layer that aligns novel mask formats with the
pretrained model's conditioning channels. This design lets users adapt models
to new datasets with a different set of anatomical structures to the base
model's original set.
  Through a targeted adaptation strategy, we find that adapting only MLP layers
suffices for high-fidelity TEE synthesis. Finally, mixing less than 200 real
TEE frames with our synthetic echoes improves the dice score on a multiclass
segmentation task, particularly boosting performance on underrepresented
right-heart structures. Our results demonstrate that (1) semantically
controlled TEE images can be generated with low overhead, (2) MaskR$^2$
effectively transforms unseen mask formats into compatible formats without
damaging downstream task performance, and (3) our method generates images that
are effective for improving performance on a downstream task of multiclass
segmentation.
