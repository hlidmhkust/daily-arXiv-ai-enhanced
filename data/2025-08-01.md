### [1] [A CPFSK Transceiver with Hybrid CSS-DSSS Spreading for LPWAN PHY Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23029)
*Wenkun Wen,Ruiqi Zhang,Peiran Wu,Tierui Min,Minghua Xia*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种新型LPWAN收发器，通过CSS前导和CPFSK-DSSS混合调制，实现高接收灵敏度和低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LPWAN收发器在覆盖深度和数据速率之间存在权衡，需要一种兼顾高灵敏度和低复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 采用CSS前导简化同步，结合CPFSK-DSSS调制提高覆盖性能，接收端使用双峰检测和非相干解调方案。

Result: 仿真和实地测试表明，该收发器在接收灵敏度和复杂度上优于传统方案。

Conclusion: 新型收发器为LPWAN提供了一种高性能、低成本的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) transceivers typically
compromise data rates to achieve deep coverage. This paper presents a novel
transceiver that achieves high receiver sensitivity and low computational
complexity. At the transmitter, we replace the conventional direct sequence
spread spectrum (DSSS) preamble with a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) preamble,
consisting of a pair of down-chirp and up-chirp signals that are conjugate to
each other, simplifying packet synchronization. For enhanced coverage, the
payload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to
maintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to
achieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak
detection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint
despreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while
maintaining simplicity in implementation. Furthermore, we optimize the preamble
detection threshold and spreading sequences for maximum non-coherent receiver
performance. The software-defined radio (SDR) prototype, developed using GNU
Radio and USRP, along with operational snapshots, showcases its practical
engineering applications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field-test
trials demonstrate that our transceiver outperforms traditional ones in terms
of receiver sensitivity, while also being low in complexity and cost-effective
for LPWAN requirements.

### [2] [Optimal compressed sensing for mixing stochastic processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23175)
*Yonatan Gutman,Adam Śpiewak*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文证明了在压缩感知中，平均信息维度是恢复ψ*-混合过程的精确阈值，低于此阈值则无法实现几乎无损恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨压缩感知中随机线性测量数量与平均信息维度的关系，明确其作为恢复极限的重要性。

Method: 引入相关维度率作为新指标，结合几何测度理论技术，分析压缩感知的极限。

Result: 平均信息维度是压缩感知的精确阈值，低于此值则几乎无损恢复不可能。

Conclusion: 平均信息维度是压缩感知中的基本限制，相关维度率为任意平稳过程提供了下限。

Abstract: Jalali and Poor introduced an asymptotic framework for compressed sensing of
stochastic processes, demonstrating that any rate strictly greater than the
mean information dimension serves as an upper bound on the number of random
linear measurements required for (universal) almost lossless recovery of
$\psi^*$-mixing processes, as measured in the normalized $L^2$ norm. In this
work, we show that if the normalized number of random linear measurements is
strictly less than the mean information dimension, then almost lossless
recovery of a $\psi^*$-mixing process is impossible by any sequence of
decompressors. This establishes the mean information dimension as the
fundamental limit for compressed sensing in this setting (and, in fact, the
precise threshold for the problem). To this end, we introduce a new quantity,
related to techniques from geometric measure theory: the correlation dimension
rate, which is shown to be a lower bound for compressed sensing of arbitrary
stationary stochastic processes.

### [3] [The Construction of Near-optimal Universal Coding of Integers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23180)
*Wei Yan,Yunghsiang S. Han*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种近乎最优的通用整数编码（UCI）方法，称为ν码，其最小扩展因子为2.0386，进一步缩小了最优UCI的最小扩展因子范围。同时，还构造了一种新的UCI方法Δδ码，并证明其与ν码在当前是最优的。此外，还提供了一个新的证明，表明最优UCI的最小扩展因子下界为2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通用整数编码（UCI）的最小扩展因子，以优化压缩性能。

Method: 提出ν码和Δδ码两种新的UCI方法，并通过理论分析证明其最优性。

Result: ν码的最小扩展因子为2.0386，缩小了最优UCI的最小扩展因子范围至2≤C∗≤2.0386。Δδ码与ν码在当前是最优的。

Conclusion: ν码和Δδ码在最小扩展因子方面表现优异，为UCI的优化提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Universal Coding of Integers (UCI) is suitable for discrete memoryless
sources with unknown probability distributions and infinitely countable
alphabet sizes. The UCI is a class of prefix codes, such that the ratio of the
average codeword length to $\max\{1, H(P)\}$ is within a constant expansion
factor $K_{\mathcal{C}}$ for any decreasing probability distribution $P$, where
$H(P)$ is the entropy of $P$. For any UCI code $\mathcal{C}$, define \emph{the
minimum expansion factor} $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ to represent the infimum of the
set of extension factors of $\mathcal{C}$. Each $\mathcal{C}$ has a unique
corresponding $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$, and the smaller $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is,
the better the compression performance of $\mathcal{C}$ is. A class of UCI
$\mathcal{C}$ (or family $\{\mathcal{C}_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$) achieving the
smallest $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is defined as the \emph{optimal UCI}. The best
result currently is that the range of $C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ for the optimal UCI
is $2\leq C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq 2.5$. In this paper, we prove that there
exists a class of near-optimal UCIs, called $\nu$ code, to achieve
$K_\nu=2.0386$. This narrows the range of the minimum expansion factor for
optimal UCI to $2\leq C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq 2.0386$. Another new class of
UCI, called $\Delta\delta$ code, is specifically constructed. We show that the
$\Delta\delta$ code and $\nu$ code are currently optimal in terms of minimum
expansion factor. In addition, we propose a new proof that shows the minimum
expansion factor of the optimal UCI is lower bounded by $2$.

### [4] [Efficient DFT of Zadoff-Chu Sequences using lmFH Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23200)
*Fanping Du*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文通过线性微频率跳变（lmFH）模式直观展示了ZC序列的DFT和IDFT计算，并引入广义二次高斯和计算累积和。进一步证明ZC序列的DFT可转化为lmFH符号，实现类似mFH符号的计算。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ZC序列在微频率跳变（mFH）中的特性，简化DFT和IDFT的计算方法。

Method: 利用lmFH模式分析ZC序列的DFT和IDFT，引入广义二次高斯和计算累积和，并将DFT转化为lmFH符号。

Result: 发现ZC序列的DFT可通过累积频率点计算，类似于mFH符号的计算方式。

Conclusion: ZC序列的DFT计算可通过lmFH模式简化，为相关应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear
micro-frequency hopping (lmFH) symbols, this paper first presents an intuitive
and visual exposition of the computation of the DFT and IDFT of ZC sequences
using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an
alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the
Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the
micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC
sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase
offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative
frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.

### [5] [Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Stochastic Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23234)
*Marziyeh Soltani,Mahtab Mirmohseni,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文分析了多输入多输出（MIMO）集成感知与通信（ISAC）系统在下行链路场景中的随机安全性能，考虑了通信和感知的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在随机网络中如何同时实现通信、感知目标位置和对抗窃听威胁的安全性能。

Method: 通过推导遍历保密率（ESR）和遍历Cramer-Rao下界（CRB），分析信号噪声比（SNR）和CRB的概率密度函数（PDF），并利用中心极限定理简化计算。

Result: 刻画了CRB-保密率区域的边界，揭示了通信和感知之间的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 在随机ISAC网络中，通过优化设计可以实现通信和感知的平衡，同时保障安全和隐私。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a
downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to
simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and
counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive
single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as
well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's
location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays
the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers
channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly
distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the
ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for
target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves
computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We
characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the
performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a
level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.

Conclusion: IRS的可移动元素能显著提升ISAC系统的整体性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to exploit movable elements of intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance the overall performance of integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Firstly, focusing on a single-user
scenario, we reveal the function of movable elements by performance analysis,
and then design a joint beamforming and element position optimization scheme.
Further, we extend it to a general multi-user scenario, and also propose an
element position optimization scheme according to the derived performance
expressions. Finally, simulation results confirm that the movement of IRS
elements can improve the communication rate and the sensing accuracy, and
especially broaden the coverage of ISAC.

Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future
wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has
attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic
communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it
introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in
wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer
hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to
the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the
semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground
transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric
(SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption,
and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we
utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed
network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed
transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM,
illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.

### [8] [From Link Diversity to Cross-Band Feedback Collaboration: A New Perspective on Hybrid Optical-RF Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23686)
*Menghan Li,Yulin Shao,Runxin Zhang,Lu Lu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的混合光-射频（O-RF）系统架构，利用光学下行链路为射频上行链路提供实时反馈，提升可靠性，而非传统的链路多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为混合光-射频系统主要用于链路多样性，但作者认为可以通过光学下行链路反馈提升射频上行链路的性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为O-RF-CBF的新架构，利用光学下行链路反馈实现射频上行链路的自适应编码。

Result: 数值结果显示，O-RF-CBF在提升上行链路吞吐量方面显著优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 研究表明，跨频段协作而非冗余是混合无线网络发挥潜力的关键。

Abstract: We suggest a re-examination of the conventional view that hybrid
optical-radio frequency (O-RF) systems are primarily diversity-driven networks
that switch between RF and optical links for robustness. Instead, we uncover a
new architectural opportunity: repurposing the optical downlink to enable
real-time feedback channel coding over the RF uplink, where structured decoder
feedback is delivered from the access point to guide the transmitter's coding
strategy. This insight marks a conceptual paradigm shift from passive link
diversity to active cross-band collaboration, where the wideband,
interference-free optical wireless communication (OWC) is no longer merely a
downlink backup but a functional enabler of uplink reliability. To realize this
vision, we propose a novel architecture, O-RF with Cross-Band Feedback
(O-RF-CBF), that exploits the optical downlink feedback to facilitate adaptive
RF uplink coding. Numerical results reveal that O-RF-CBF achieves significant
uplink throughput gains over traditional O-RF systems. Our findings highlight
that inter-band synergy, not redundancy, is the key to unlocking the full
potential of hybrid wireless networks.

### [9] [Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23702)
*Duc Thien Hua,Mohammadali Mohammadi,Hien Quoc Ngo,Michail Matthaiou*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了将BDRIS集成到CFmMIMO系统中以增强SWIPT性能，通过优化AP选择、功率控制和BDRIS散射矩阵设计，显著提升了能量收集效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于通过BDRIS技术提升CFmMIMO系统的SWIPT性能，同时支持能量接收器和信息接收器，避免资源浪费。

Method: 采用保护性部分零预编码技术管理干扰，提出启发式搜索、凸近似和深度强化学习算法优化AP选择和功率控制。

Result: 数值结果显示，BDRIS在能量收集方面显著优于传统RIS，启发式设计使平均能量收集提升七倍。

Conclusion: BDRIS在CFmMIMO系统中具有显著优势，尤其在能量收集方面表现突出。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output
(CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy
receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time
frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving
ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A
protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs
to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,
closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average
sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power
control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term
statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then
effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,
efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the
scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep
reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power
control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully
connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the
conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in
the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix
design is employed.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CADS是一个开源框架，专注于整合和标准化异构数据源，用于全身CT分割，通过大规模数据集和模型提升临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI分割方法针对单个结构，导致模型碎片化和评估不一致，缺乏全面训练数据。

Method: 提出CADS框架，整合22,022个CT扫描的大规模数据集，标注167个解剖结构，并开发基于现有架构的模型。

Result: 在18个公共数据集和真实医院队列中表现优于现有方法，验证了临床实用性。

Conclusion: 通过公开数据集、模型和工具，推动放射学中稳健AI解决方案的发展。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of anatomical structures in volumetric CT scans is
crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. While AI has advanced automated
segmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,
creating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance
and disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address
these limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single
model. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,
which is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data
heterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather
than pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,
an open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,
standardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT
segmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with
complete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant
advancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing
collections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets. Building on this diverse
dataset, we develop the CADS-model using established architectures for
accessible and automated full-body CT segmentation. Through comprehensive
evaluation across 18 public datasets and an independent real-world hospital
cohort, we demonstrate advantages over SoTA approaches. Notably, thorough
testing of the model's performance in segmentation tasks from radiation
oncology validates its direct utility for clinical interventions. By making our
large-scale dataset, our segmentation models, and our clinical software tool
publicly available, we aim to advance robust AI solutions in radiology and make
comprehensive anatomical analysis accessible to clinicians and researchers
alike.

### [11] [LesionGen: A Concept-Guided Diffusion Model for Dermatology Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23001)
*Jamil Fayyad,Nourhan Bayasi,Ziyang Yu,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LesionGen是一种基于文本到图像扩散概率模型（T2I-DPM）的皮肤病图像合成框架，通过高质量图像-描述对生成多样且真实的皮肤病变图像，弥补数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病分类的深度学习模型需要大量多样且标注良好的数据，但实际中数据常因隐私、标注成本高和代表性不足而受限。

Method: LesionGen利用专家标注和伪生成的概念丰富描述，微调预训练的扩散模型，生成基于皮肤病学描述的图像。

Result: 实验表明，仅用合成数据训练的模型分类准确率接近真实数据训练模型，且在少数群体表现上有显著提升。

Conclusion: LesionGen为皮肤病图像合成提供了有效解决方案，缓解了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

*Jonathan Monsalve,Kumar Vijay Mishra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用去噪扩散模型优化梯度噪声的新框架，用于高光谱成像中的统计结构恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像中，由于传感器或带宽限制，难以获取完整数据，传统方法在分区估计统计量时会引入梯度噪声。

Result: 在高光谱恢复任务中，与传统方法相比，显著提高了收敛性和重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法将生成建模与逆问题求解结合，为高光谱成像中的统计恢复提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional statistical structure from limited measurements
is a fundamental challenge in hyperspectral imaging, where capturing
full-resolution data is often infeasible due to sensor, bandwidth, or
acquisition constraints. A common workaround is to partition measurements and
estimate local statistics-such as the covariance matrix-using only partial
observations. However, this strategy introduces noise in the optimization
gradients, especially when each partition contains few samples. In this work,
we reinterpret this accumulation of gradient noise as a diffusion process,
where successive partitions inject increasing uncertainty into the learning
signal. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that leverages
denoising diffusion models to learn a reverse process in gradient space. The
model is trained to map noisy gradient estimates toward clean, well-conditioned
updates, effectively preconditioning the optimization. Our approach bridges
generative modeling and inverse problem solving, improving convergence and
reconstruction quality under aggressive sampling regimes. We validate our
method on hyperspectral recovery tasks, demonstrating significant gains in
accuracy and stability over traditional optimization pipelines.

extensible framework for MR image reconstruction. With reproducibility and
maintainability at its core, it facilitates collaborative development and
provides a foundation for future MR imaging research.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于小波变换的RAW图像任意尺度下采样框架，结合低频和高频模块，保留细节，并通过新数据集验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在sRGB域下采样易导致模糊和伪影，而RAW图像缺乏专门的下采样框架。

Method: 提出小波循环重建框架，包括低频任意尺度下采样模块（LASDM）和高频预测模块（HFPM），并使用能量最大化损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和视觉上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RAW图像下采样问题，并发布了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

Conclusion: EMORe虽增加计算复杂度，但显著提升5D心脏MRI的临床适用性和诊断信心。

Abstract: We propose EMORe, an adaptive reconstruction method designed to enhance
motion robustness in free-running, free-breathing self-gated 5D cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Traditional self-gating-based motion binning
for 5D MRI often results in residual motion artifacts due to inaccuracies in
cardiac and respiratory signal extraction and sporadic bulk motion,
compromising clinical utility. EMORe addresses these issues by integrating
adaptive inter-bin correction and explicit outlier rejection within an
expectation-maximization (EM) framework, whereby the E-step and M-step are
executed alternately until convergence. In the E-step, probabilistic (soft) bin
assignments are refined by correcting misassignment of valid data and rejecting
motion-corrupted data to a dedicated outlier bin. In the M-step, the image
estimate is improved using the refined soft bin assignments. Validation in a
simulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared
to standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements
in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and
bin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo
validation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly
enhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts
compared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled
coughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in
computational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion
artifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic
confidence of 5D cardiac MRI.

Conclusion: EMedNeXt在资源匮乏地区表现出色，为脑肿瘤分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统深度神经网络模型大、能耗高，不适合资源受限的边缘设备，且RGB转换会消耗额外能量，因此需要一种更高效的图像分类方法。

Method: 使用仅含63,000参数的CNN结合Viterbi解码的时间序列分析，直接在Bayer图像上进行分类，并在定制的PULPissimo芯片上实现。

Result: 分类准确率达93.06%，每张图像仅需5.31μJ能量，相比传统胶囊内窥镜节省89.9%的能耗。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了能耗，为资源受限的边缘设备提供了一种高效的AI图像分类解决方案。

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing

Conclusion: 持续学习有望推动可部署的疟疾CAD工具开发。

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

Method: 提出两阶段感知框架，包括三种目标数量感知方法（改进的EDC、基于统计特征的DNN、利用全特征值的1D-CNN）和低复杂度高精度的OMC-DOA方向估计方法。

Result: 三种方法在中高信噪比下实现100%目标数量感知，1D-CNN在极低信噪比下表现优异；OMC-DOA在多源环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H2AD MIMO架构通过两阶段感知框架有效解决了多目标感知问题，为未来无线网络提供了绿色高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

Conclusion: BS-1-to-N方法通过挖掘CKM与基站位置的隐含关联，实现了高效的跨基站CKM推理，适用于大规模分布式网络。

Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) inference across base stations (BSs) is the key
to achieving efficient environmentaware communications. This paper proposes an
environmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the
generative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location
embedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS
location information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the
cross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to
respectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as
that among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target
BSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM
inference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.
Specifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free
networks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM
construction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N
model is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any
potential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by
exploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same
wireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to
multi-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same
wireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit
correlation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the
proposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We
provide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N
generative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to
demonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a
promising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling
flexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the
interconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave
reconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at
one port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local
control of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further
enhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,
channel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among
non-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of
NR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices
communicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure
transmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses
signal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a
physics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural
scattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,
the advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate
an all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization
algorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual
decomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS
consistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal
(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two
impinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the
power of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure
transmission can be achieved.

Conclusion: EVMx架构能显著加速智能合约执行，提升EVM兼容区块链的性能。

Abstract: Ethereum blockchain uses smart contracts (SCs) to implement decentralized
applications (dApps). SCs are executed by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)
running within an Ethereum client. Moreover, the EVM has been widely adopted by
other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Cardano, Avalanche, Polkadot, and
more. However, the EVM performance is limited by the constraints of the
general-purpose computer it operates on. This work proposes offloading SC
execution onto a dedicated hardware-based EVM. Specifically, EVMx is an
FPGA-based SC execution engine that benefits from the inherent parallelism and
high-speed processing capabilities of a hardware architecture. Synthesis
results demonstrate a reduction in execution time of 61% to 99% for commonly
used operation codes compared to CPU-based SC execution environments. Moreover,
the execution time of Ethereum blocks on EVMx is up to 6x faster compared to
analogous works in the literature. These results highlight the potential of the
proposed architecture to accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of
EVM-compatible blockchains.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely
large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in
extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs
significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial
resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift
communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where
spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle
and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel
estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field
scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel
estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an
electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,
alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream
near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major
estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations
(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and
RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among
estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide
insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel
estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research
directions.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless
networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and
achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into
interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and
extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of
the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of
sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions.
Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or
user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the
network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also
have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate
maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable
transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably
optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification
for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable
rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an
alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO
literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the
beamforming strategy.

Conclusion: MPGFRFT框架在多种图信号处理任务中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT) applies a single global
fractional order to all graph frequencies, which restricts its adaptability to
diverse signal characteristics across the spectral domain. To address this
limitation, in this paper, we propose two types of multiple-parameter GFRFTs
(MPGFRFTs) and establish their corresponding theoretical frameworks. We design
a spectral compression strategy tailored for ultra-low compression ratios,
effectively preserving essential information even under extreme dimensionality
reduction. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a learnable order vector scheme
that enables adaptive compression and denoising, demonstrating strong
performance on both graph signals and images. We explore the application of
MPGFRFTs to image encryption and decryption. Experimental results validate the
versatility and superior performance of the proposed MPGFRFT framework across
various graph signal processing tasks.

Abstract: Real-time transmission of high-resolution video signals in an uncompressed
and unencrypted format requires an ultra-reliable and low-latency
communications (URLLC) medium with high bandwidth to maintain the quality of
experience (QoE) for users. We put forward the design and experimental
demonstration of a high-performance laser-based optical wireless communication
(OWC) system that enables high-definition (HD) video transmission with
submillisecond latencies. The serial digital interface (SDI) output of a camera
is used to transmit the live video stream over an optical wireless link by
directly modulating the SDI signal on the intensity of a 940 nm vertical cavity
surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The proposed SDI over light fidelity (LiFi)
system corroborates error-free transmission of full HD (FHD) and 4K
ultra-high-definition (UHD) resolutions at data rates of 2.97 Gb/s and 5.94
Gb/s, respectively, with a measured end-to-end latency of under 35 ns. Since
SDI standards support various video formats and VCSELs are high-bandwidth and
low-power devices, this presents a scalable and inexpensive solution for
wireless connectivity between professional broadcast equipment using
off-the-shelf SDI components.
