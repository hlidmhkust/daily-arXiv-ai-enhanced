### [1] [Nonlinear Stacked Intelligent Surfaces for Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23780)
*Omran Abbas,Abdullah Zayat,Loıc Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出非线性堆叠智能表面(SIS)概念，能够模拟神经网络行为，相比线性SIS在MIMO系统中显著降低符号错误率，提供更高通信可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SIS只能实现线性操作，限制了其应用潜力。为了释放SIS的更多可能性，需要开发能够执行非线性操作的SIS技术。

Method: 设计具有阶跃响应的非线性SIS单元，在MIMO系统中部署非线性SIS，仅使用统计信道信息来优化结构以最小化符号错误率。

Result: 非线性SIS通过在表面形成复杂信号模式，提供更高的抗噪声干扰多样性，相比线性SIS显著提高了通信可靠性。

Conclusion: 非线性SIS是下一代无线系统的有前景技术，能够实现更复杂的信号处理功能，在多种无线通信场景中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) are a promising technology for
next-generation wireless systems, offering an opportunity to enhance
communication performance with low power consumption. Typically, an SIS is
modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic
signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of
operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear
operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that
can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the
feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell
with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of
nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to
minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at
both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel
information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication
reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across
the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances,
while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we
outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless
communication scenarios.

### [2] [Communication in a Fractional World: MIMO MC-OTFS Precoder Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23832)
*Evan Allen,Karim Said,Robert Calderbank,Lingjia Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架，用于高移动性MIMO通信中的CSI预测，特别针对OTFS调制系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G高移动性场景下传统时频CSI反馈方案难以应对快速变化的信道条件，需要转向更稳定的延迟-多普勒表示方法。

Method: 推导了OTFS输入输出关系随时间变化的表达式，并基于此创建了物理信息驱动的复杂指数基扩展模型预测框架。

Result: 该框架能够最大化过时CSI的效用，支持整数和分数延迟-多普勒信道，促进高移动性MIMO通信。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为高移动性环境下的MIMO通信提供了有效的CSI预测解决方案，特别适用于MANETs、VANETs和FANETs等场景。

Abstract: As 6G technologies advance, international bodies and regulatory agencies are
intensifying efforts to extend seamless connectivity especially for
high-mobility scenarios such as Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{MANETs}) types
such as Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (\textit{VANETs}) and Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
(\textit{FANETs}). For these environments to be considered for long term
adoption and use they must support Multiple-Input-Multiple- (MIMO) technology,
rapidly fluctuating channel conditions in these environments place a heavy
burden on traditional time-frequency CSI feedback schemes required for MIMO
precoding. This motivates a shift toward delay-Doppler representations like
those employed by Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space(OTFS) modulation, which
offers greater stability under mobility. We derive an expression for the
variation over time in the OTFS I/O relationship. We then use this to create a
physics informed complex exponential basis expansion model prediction framework
that maximizes the usefulness of outdated Channel State Information (CSI) in
the presence of integer and fractional delay-Doppler channels and facilitates
high mobility MIMO communication.

### [3] [Coordinated Multipoint Transmission in Pinching Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23837)
*Ali Amhaz,Shreya Khisa,Mohamed Elhattab,Chadi Assi,Sanaa Sharafeddine*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究使用夹持天线系统的协作多点传输，通过梯度元学习策略优化波束成形和夹持位置，以最大化可实现的和速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协作多点系统采用均匀线性阵列时存在速率上限限制，而夹持天线技术有望克服MIMO系统中的大规模衰落问题。

Method: 采用梯度元学习策略联合优化发射波束成形向量和波导上的夹持位置，解决非凸优化问题。

Result: 数值分析显示所提方法达到最优解的92%，相比传统CoMP系统实现了更高的速率上限。

Conclusion: 夹持天线技术与梯度元学习相结合能有效提升协作多点传输系统的性能。

Abstract: We study a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission where two base
stations (BSs), each supported by a pinching antenna system (PASS), are
deployed to jointly serve communication users under spatial division multiple
access (SDMA) technology. Pinching Antenna technology was introduced as a
promising solution to overcome the large-scale fading that has been shown to be
an impediment in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To realize the
advantages of this technology in CoMP systems, which suffer from an upperbound
rate limitation when traditional uniform linear arrays (ULAs) are adopted, we
formulate an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the achievable sum
rate by jointly determining the transmit beamforming vectors and pinching
locations on the waveguides while respecting the quality of service (QoS)
requirements of users. This problem is inherently non-convex due to the strong
coupling among its decision parameters, making it challenging to solve using
traditional optimization methods. Thus, we utilize a gradient-based
meta-learning (GML) strategy specifically designed for large-scale optimization
tasks. Finally, numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed GML approach, achieving 92 percent of the optimal solution, and the
superiority of the solution presented compared to other benchmarks. In
addition, it achieves a higher upper bound on the achievable rate compared to
conventional CoMP systems.

### [4] [Accurate Prediction of Nonlinear Distortion of Multi-Carrier Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23844)
*Cameron M. Pike,Brad Oney,Gabriel Hepner,Animesh Yadav*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 使用特征函数级数法预测稀疏多载波传输中的非线性失真频谱，该方法计算效率高，能准确预测功放非线性对多载波调制的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功率放大器的非线性会严重影响多载波调制技术，准确预测非线性失真对于在输出功率和网络吞吐量之间进行设计权衡至关重要。

Method: 采用特征函数级数法，将非线性表示为前向散射参数或跨导函数的快速傅里叶变换，失真贡献表示为干净频谱的数值自卷积。

Result: 理论验证表明该方法与经典Price定理结果一致，实际验证通过OFDM信号在压缩功放中的应用，预测输出频谱与实验室测量结果吻合。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效计算信号和失真分量，可轻松计算信噪比并在感兴趣变量（如过驱动水平）上进行参数化分析。

Abstract: Nonlinearities in power amplifiers adversely affect multi-carrier modulation
techniques. Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making
design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the
series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion
spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in
efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The
method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation
is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard
limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are
identical with the classical Price's theorem. Practical validation is shown by
considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a
fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into
compression for which application of Price's theorem is difficult, and the
predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the
computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed
as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering
parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects),
and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical
autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be
easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as
overdrive level.

### [5] [Learning-based Spectral Regression for Cocoa Bean Physicochemical Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23892)
*Kebin Contreras,Emmanuel Martinez,Brayan Monroy,Sebastian Ardila,Cristian Ramirez,Mariana Caicedo,Hans Garcia,Tatiana Gelvez-Barrera,Juan Poveda-Jaramillo,Henry Arguello,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可可豆质量评估方法耗时、破坏性且难以规模化，需要快速、可靠、非侵入性的替代方案。光谱技术提供了一种非侵入性替代方案，通过捕捉与这些性质相关的分子特征。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了传统实验室方法在可可生产链质量评估中的合适且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Cocoa bean quality assessment is essential for ensuring compliance with
commercial standards, protecting consumer health, and increasing the market
value of the cocoa product. The quality assessment estimates key
physicochemical properties, such as fermentation level, moisture content,
polyphenol concentration, and cadmium content, among others. This assessment
has traditionally relied on the accurate estimation of these properties via
visual or sensory evaluation, jointly with laboratory-based physicochemical
analyses, which are often time-consuming, destructive, and difficult to scale.
This creates the need for rapid, reliable, and noninvasive alternatives.
Spectroscopy, particularly in the visible and near-infrared ranges, offers a
non-invasive alternative by capturing the molecular signatures associated with
these properties. Therefore, this work introduces a scalable methodology for
evaluating the quality of cocoa beans by predicting key physicochemical
properties from the spectral signatures of cocoa beans. This approach utilizes
a conveyor belt system integrated with a VIS-NIR spectrometer, coupled with
learning-based regression models. Furthermore, a dataset is built using cocoa
bean batches from Santander, Colombia. Ground-truth reference values were
obtained through standardized laboratory analyses and following commercial
cocoa quality regulations. To further evaluate the proposed methodology's
generalization, performance is tested on samples collected from other Colombian
regions and from Cusco, Peru. Experimental results show that the proposed
models achieved R2 scores exceeding 0.98 across all physicochemical properties,
and reached 0.96 accuracy on geographically independent samples. This
non-destructive approach represents a suitable and scalable alternative to
conventional laboratory methods for quality assessment across the cocoa
production chain.

Abstract: This paper presents a new derivation of LEO-to-ground receiver channel model
to address a clear gap in the prior art: the lack of an appropriate geometry
aware characterization of non LOS (NLOS) link model represented by the power
spectral density (PSD). Specifically, the main contribution is a coherent
derivation of the PSD from 1st principles that is able to reproduce results in
prior art and explain the causal relationship of main PSD features to the
propagation geometry parameters.

### [7] [Inferring Group Intent as a Cooperative Game. An NLP-based Framework for Trajectory Analysis using Graph Transformer Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23905)
*Yiming Zhang,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Shashwat Jain*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将合作博弈论与NLP生成模型相结合，为群体目标轨迹意图的建模和推断提供了有效的多层级解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a
cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an
NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by
the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players
in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or
the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that
govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect
the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the
intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic
function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy
observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a
Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which
yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal
patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based
generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic
multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph
Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as
the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data
with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the
track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer
approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN
(for group intent inference).

### [8] [Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908)
*M. T. Hassan,D. Zelenchuk,M. A. B. Abbasi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的用户定位框架，用于RIS辅助的6G毫米波通信，通过测量四个角扇区的接收信号功率来实时预测用户角度位置，显著减少波束搜索开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G毫米波通信需要精确的波束对准，但RIS扩展了波束搜索空间，使穷举扫描效率低下，存在控制开销和延迟问题。

Method: 使用20x20 RIS在27GHz频段反射信号，将0-90度仰角平面分为四个扇区，记录接收信号功率数据集，训练多种回归模型（DT、SVR、KNN、XGBoost等）进行用户角度预测。

Result: 决策树模型表现最佳，MAE为4.8度，R²=0.96，其他模型达到70-86%准确率，预测辐射模式与真实值高度一致。

Conclusion: 该框架减少了波束探测，实现了更快的对准，降低了RIS辅助6G网络的延迟。

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit
connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam
alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation
and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base
station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and
latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted
communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network
connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane,
divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received
signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors,
including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest
neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an
unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per
sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the
user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error
(MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy.
The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models
reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe
alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework
reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS
assisted 6G networks.

### [9] [Localized Acoustic-Event Measurement Probe: Connector Confirmation Utilizing Acoustic Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24017)
*Brian Skoglind,Travis Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron Turner,Laine Mears*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于声学检测的电气连接状态验证系统，通过物理降噪和声音特征放大算法提高信噪比，在不改变现有手动连接流程的情况下，有效检测连接状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电子产品中电气连接仍主要依赖人工操作，容易因连接力不均或人为疲劳导致连接不良，传统检测方法如视觉验证、增强现实或电路参数测量在检测连接状态方面能力有限。

Method: 采用物理系统进行背景噪声抑制，并结合成功连接声音特征放大算法，提高电气连接声音与工厂环境声音之间的信噪比。

Result: 该解决方案在检测和分类连接状态方面效果超过75%，且无需对现有手动连接流程进行任何修改。

Conclusion: 声学验证系统是检测电气连接状态的有效方法，通过提高信噪比可以克服工厂环境中声音干扰的问题。

Abstract: Modern consumer products are full of interconnected electrical and electronic
modules to fulfill direct and indirect needs. In an automated assembly line
still, most of these interconnections are required to be done manually due to
the large variety of connector types, connector positions, and the soft,
flexible nature of their structures. The manual connection points are the
source of partial or completely loose connections. Sometimes connections are
missed due to the application of unequal mating forces and natural human
fatigue. Subsequently, these defects can lead to unexpected downtime and
expensive rework. For successful connection detection, past approaches such as
vision verification, Augmented Reality, or circuit parameter-based measurements
have shown limited ability to detect the correct connection state. Though most
connections emit a specific noise for successful mating, the acoustic-based
verification system for electrical connection confirmation has not been
extensively researched. The main discouraging reason for such research is the
typically low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between the sound of a pair of
electrical connector mating and the diverse soundscape of the plant. In this
study, the authors investigated increasing the SNR between the electrical
connector mating sound and the plant soundscape to improve connection success
detection by employing a physical system for background noise mitigation and
the successful met noise signature amplification algorithm. The solution is
over 75% effective at detecting and classifying connection state. The solution
has been constructed without any modification to the existing manual
interconnection process.

### [10] [PULSE: Privileged Knowledge Transfer from Electrodermal Activity to Low-Cost Sensors for Stress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24058)
*Zihan Zhao,Masood Mortazavi,Ning Yan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PULSE框架通过自监督预训练利用EDA信号，在推理阶段仅使用低成本传感器（ECG、BVP、ACC、TEMP）进行压力检测，通过知识迁移将EDA的表示转移到学生编码器中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EDA是压力检测的主要信号，但硬件成本高且在实际可穿戴设备中不常见。需要开发一种方法，在训练时利用EDA，但在推理时仅使用更易获得的传感器模态。

Method: 1. 将编码器输出分离为共享和私有嵌入；2. 跨模态对齐共享嵌入并融合为模态不变表示；3. 私有嵌入携带模态特定信息支持重建目标；4. 预训练后通过冻结的EDA教师模型将交感神经唤醒表示转移到学生编码器。

Result: 在WESAD数据集上，该方法实现了强大的压力检测性能，表明特权EDA的表示可以转移到低成本传感器以提高准确性。

Conclusion: PULSE框架成功地将昂贵的EDA传感器的表示知识迁移到低成本传感器上，在保持高性能的同时降低了硬件成本。

Abstract: Electrodermal activity (EDA), the primary signal for stress detection,
requires costly hardware often unavailable in real-world wearables. In this
paper, we propose PULSE, a framework that utilizes EDA exclusively during
self-supervised pretraining, while enabling inference without EDA but with more
readily available modalities such as ECG, BVP, ACC, and TEMP. Our approach
separates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared
embeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant
representation. The private embeddings carry modality-specific information to
support the reconstruction objective. Pretraining is followed by knowledge
transfer where a frozen EDA teacher transfers sympathetic-arousal
representations into student encoders. On WESAD, our method achieves strong
stress-detection performance, showing that representations of privileged EDA
can be transferred to low-cost sensors to improve accuracy while reducing
hardware cost.

Conclusion: 子带全双工是同时实现上行通信和目标参数估计的有效替代双工方案，通过频域分离有效处理干扰。

Abstract: In-band Full-duplex joint communication and sensing systems require self
interference cancellation as well as decoupling of the mutual interference
between UL communication signals and radar echoes. We present sub-band
full-duplex as an alternative duplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous uplink
communication and target parameter estimation in a cell-free massive MIMO
system. Sub-band full-duplex allows uplink and downlink transmissions
simultaneously on non-overlapping frequency resources via explicitly defined
uplink and downlink sub-bands in each timeslot. Thus, we propose a sub-band
full-duplex cell-free massive MIMO system with active downlink sensing on
downlink sub-bands and uplink communication on uplink sub-band. In the proposed
system, the target illumination signal is transmitted on the downlink (radar)
sub-band whereas uplink users transmit on the uplink (communication) sub-band.
By assuming efficient suppression of inter-sub-band interference between radar
and communication sub-bands, uplink communication and radar signals can be
efficiently processed without mutual interference. We show that each AP can
estimate sensing parameters with high accuracy in SBFD cell-free massive MIMO
JCAS systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调制分类技术的进步虽然推动了非合作通信场景下的信号感知技术发展，但也使窃听者能够有效拦截用户信号。为了保护通信链路中的用户隐私，需要开发能够抵御自动调制分类系统的防护方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效保护无线通信中的用户隐私，防止信号被自动调制分类系统识别，同时保持对抗扰动的隐蔽性。

Abstract: The advancements in Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) have propelled
the development of signal sensing and identification technologies in
non-cooperative communication scenarios but also enable eavesdroppers to
effectively intercept user signals in wireless communication environments. To
protect user privacy in communication links, we have optimized the adversarial
example generation model and introduced a novel framework for generating
adversarial perturbations for transmitted signals. This framework implements
dual-domain constraints in both the time and frequency domains, ensuring that
the adversarial perturbation cannot be filtered out. Comparative experiments
confirm the superiority of the proposed method and the concealment of the
adversarial examples it generates.

*Mahmut Kemal Ercan,Alireza Pourafzal,Musa Furkan Keskin,Sinan Gezici,Henk Wymeersch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种OFDM导频失真方法，通过优化子载波失真向量来干扰到达时间估计，同时保持通信性能。该方法无需协议修改或人工路径注入，在信号层面控制ToA可观测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在保持通信性能的同时，通过故意扭曲上行OFDM导频来干扰基站对到达时间的估计，提供信号层面的隐私保护机制。

Method: 设计复杂的子载波失真向量，使用两个目标函数（旁瓣峰值比和积分旁瓣水平）来增加失配模糊函数的旁瓣。采用Dinkelbach变换和凸差更新求解广义分数规划问题。

Result: 仿真显示优化的失真显著提高了MAF旁瓣水平，降低了延迟估计精度，同时在整个信噪比范围内仅造成轻微容量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了在通信约束下控制到达时间可观测性的目标，为信号级隐私保护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We study uplink orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
distortion to deliberately obfuscate time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation at a
single base station while preserving communication performance. We design a
complex per-subcarrier distortion vector that increases sidelobes of the
mismatched ambiguity function (MAF) relative to its mainlobe, using two
objectives: the sidelobe-to-peak level ratio and the integrated sidelobe level.
The design is subject to a transmit-power budget and a proximity
(dissimilarity) constraint around the communication-optimal pilot.
Communication impact is quantied by a capacity-motivated lower bound obtained
from the linear minimum mean-squared error error covariance with a mismatched
channel estimate. The resulting generalized fractional program is solved with
Dinkelbach's transform and a difference-of-convex update that yields a
closed-form Karush-Kuhn-Tucker step. Simulations on a single-input
single-output OFDM link show that the optimized distortions raise MAF sidelobes
and degrade delay estimation, as validated by a mismatched maximum-likelihood
ToA estimator, while incurring only marginal capacity loss over a broad
signal-to-noise ratio range. The method requires no protocol changes or
artificial path injection and provides a signal-level mechanism to control ToA
observability under communication constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了全双工ISAC系统中的通信-感知权衡问题，为多目标场景下的波束模式设计和性能优化提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) system, in which the base station (BS) performs downlink
and uplink communications with multiple users while simultaneously sensing
multiple targets. In the scope of this work, we assume a narrowband and static
scenario, aiming to focus on the beamforming and power allocation strategies.
We propose a joint beamforming strategy for designing transmit and receive
beamformer vectors at the BS. The optimization problem aims to maximize the
communication sum-rate, which is critical for ensuring high-quality service to
users, while also maintaining accurate sensing performance for detection tasks
and adhering to maximum power constraints for efficient resource usage. The
optimal receive beamformers are first derived using a closed-form Generalized
Rayleigh Quotient (GRQ) solution, reducing the variables to be optimized. Then,
the remaining problem is solved using floating-point Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The numerical results show that the proposed GA-based solution demonstrates up
to a 98% enhancement in sum-rate compared to a baseline half-duplex ISAC system
and provides better performance than a benchmark algorithm from the literature.
Additionally, it offers insights into sensing performance effects on beam

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知地形环境中，设计高效安全的无人机轨迹对于低空无线网络部署至关重要，但面临环境信息缺失的挑战。

Method: 采用数字孪生框架，无人机通过ISAC信号构建虚拟环境，结合模拟退火算法进行用户调度和TD3算法进行连续轨迹设计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法相比基线方法具有更快的收敛速度、更高的飞行安全性和更短的任务完成时间。

Conclusion: 该方案为未知环境中的低空无线网络部署提供了鲁棒高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as key enablers for low-altitude
wireless network (LAWN), particularly when terrestrial networks are
unavailable. In such scenarios, the environmental topology is typically
unknown; hence, designing efficient and safe UAV trajectories is essential yet
challenging. To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training
and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated
sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground
users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT
server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs
accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV
sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight
safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme
that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the
twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous
trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach
achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission
completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and
efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.

### [16] [Towards actionable hypotension prediction -- predicting catecholamine therapy initiation in the intensive care unit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24287)
*Richard Koebe,Noah Saibel,Juan Miguel Lopez Alcaraz,Simon Schäfer,Nils Strodthoff*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个机器学习模型来预测ICU患者是否需要开始使用儿茶酚胺治疗，而不是仅仅预测低血压。模型基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征，在预测儿茶酚胺启动方面表现优于传统的低血压预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU患者低血压常见且危及生命，但现有机器学习模型主要预测固定MAP阈值或MAP预测，忽略了治疗升级的临床决策。预测儿茶酚胺启动能提供更具临床可操作性的目标。

Method: 使用MIMIC-III数据库，将儿茶酚胺启动建模为15分钟预测窗口内的二元事件。输入特征包括两小时滑动MAP窗口的统计描述符、人口统计学、生物特征、合并症和正在进行的治疗。训练XGBoost模型并通过SHAP进行解释。

Result: 模型AUROC为0.822，显著优于低血压基线（MAP < 65，AUROC 0.686）。SHAP分析显示近期MAP值、MAP趋势和正在进行的治疗是主要预测因子。在男性、年轻患者、高BMI患者和无合并症患者中表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于MAP动态、治疗背景和患者特征预测儿茶酚胺启动，支持治疗升级的关键决策，将重点从基于阈值的警报转向可操作的决策支持。该方法在自然事件不平衡的广泛ICU队列中可行。

Abstract: Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening.
Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both
undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML)
models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting,
overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting
catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent
administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real
decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine
initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input
features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context
window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing
treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and
interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an
AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65,
AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP
trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant
predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger
patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without
comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation
based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports
the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from
threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is
feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work
should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to
include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension
prediction systems.

*Yiming Zhu,Zhuhong Zhu,Xiaodong Xu,Hongwei Hou,Wenjin Wang,Rui Ding*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种与CP-OFDMA框架完全兼容的恒包络波形设计，解决了OFDM功率效率低的问题，同时降低了收发器复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM在现代无线通信系统中广泛应用，但其包络波动大导致功率效率有限。现有高功率效率波形大多与CP-OFDMA框架不兼容，在多用户下行传输中效果不佳。

Method: 从通用CE FDMA信号模型出发，开发了CP-OFDMA兼容的波形实现结构，设计了优化的CE约束脉冲整形滤波器来抑制带外发射。针对CE调制导致的非平坦频域导频，优化了时域二进制导频序列，并提出结合延迟域去噪和功率延迟分布估计的多阶段方法。设计了利用CE接收信号周期性和共轭对称性的低复杂度MRC辅助LMMSE均衡器。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案实现了接近理想情况的误码率性能，同时相比现有CE波形解决方案显著降低了收发器复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方案成功解决了OFDM功率效率问题，实现了与现有CP-OFDMA框架的完全兼容，为多用户下行传输提供了有效的恒包络解决方案。

Abstract: OFDM is widely adopted in modern wireless communication systems, but its
power efficiency is limited by high envelope fluctuations. Although various
high power-efficiency waveforms have been proposed, most are incompatible with
the CP-OFDMA framework and remain ineffective in multi-user downlink
transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a constant-envelope (CE)
waveform design, which enables low-complexity transceiver architectures while
maintaining full compatibility with the prevailing CP-OFDMA framework.
Specifically, we start from a general CE FDMA signal model and develop a
CP-OFDMA-compatible waveform implementation structure, followed by the design
of an optimized CE-constrained pulse-shaping filter to suppress out-of-band
emissions. To tackle channel estimation challenge under non-flat
frequency-domain pilots induced by CE modulation, we optimize the time-domain
binary pilot sequence to achieve frequency-domain CE properties, and then
propose a multi-stage method combining delay-domain denoising with power delay
profile estimation to facilitate reduced-dimension LMMSE estimation.
Subsequently, we design a low-complexity maximum ratio combining-aided LMMSE
equalizer by exploiting the periodicity and conjugate symmetry of the CE
received signals. To mitigate the downlink peak-to-average power ratio increase
caused by FDMA, we further develop a multi-user downlink CE transmission scheme
including multiple access mechanism, downlink control information design, and
corresponding system-level implementation, which ensures compatibility with the
New Radio standard. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
achieves bit error rate performance close to the ideal case while significantly
reducing transceiver complexity compared to existing CE waveform solutions.

TL;DR: 提出基于学习的CSI预测框架，利用无线信道的时间相关性预测未来SINR值，以缓解TDD 5G系统中的信道老化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TDD 5G系统中，用户移动性和处理延迟导致的信道老化会降低CSI准确性，影响链路自适应和系统性能。

Method: 使用全连接DNN和LSTM网络在有效SINR域进行预测，通过EESM映射确保与现有5G标准兼容，无需持续导频信号。

Result: LSTM预测器在中等多普勒条件下，相比无预测基线，NMSE改善达2 dB，吞吐量增益达1.2 Mbps。

Conclusion: 轻量级AI CSI预测能有效缓解信道老化，增强TDD 5G系统的链路自适应性能。

Abstract: Time division duplexing (TDD) has become the dominant duplexing mode in 5G
and beyond due to its ability to exploit channel reciprocity for efficient
downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, channel aging
caused by user mobility and processing delays degrades the accuracy of CSI,
leading to suboptimal link adaptation and loss of performance. To address this
issue, we propose a learning-based CSI prediction framework that leverages
temporal correlations in wireless channels to forecast future signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) values. The prediction operates in the
effective SINR domain, obtained via exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM),
ensuring full compatibility with existing 5G standards without requiring
continuous pilot signaling. Two models are considered: a fully connected deep
neural network (DNN) and an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based network. The
simulation results show that the LSTM predictor achieves an improvement of up
to 2 dB in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and a gain of up to 1.2 Mbps
throughput over a baseline without prediction under moderate Doppler
conditions. These results confirm the potential of lightweight AI-based CSI
prediction to effectively mitigate channel aging and enhance link adaptation in
TDD 5G systems.

Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing
AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging
research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and
estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by
traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver
efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI
problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently
deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with
traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver
design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential
of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions
brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further
adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.

### [20] [Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24512)
*Magnus Heimpel,Irena Hajnsek,Othmar Frey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了三种基于系数的质量准则用于多时相InSAR中的相位链接：闭合相位系数评估相干矩阵的内部一致性，拟合优度系数量化相位历史估计的准确性，模糊系数检测不稳定但拟合良好的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多时相InSAR中，相位链接估计的相位历史需要可靠性评估，以排除不可靠像素进行后续处理。现有方法缺乏系统化的质量控制和跨不同堆栈大小的可解释性。

Method: 在统一数学框架下提出三种标准化系数：基于闭合相位的内部一致性系数、基于优化模型的拟合优度系数、以及比较原始估计与正交替代的模糊系数。所有系数都归一化到单位区间并进行噪声基底校正。

Result: 在瑞士Visp的TerraSAR-X数据实验中，闭合相位系数有效预筛选稳定区域，拟合优度系数与现有质量指标一致并系统化推广，模糊系数标记拟合良好但不稳定的解。

Conclusion: 这三种系数共同实现了分布式散射体干涉处理中系统化的像素选择和质量控制，提高了相位链接估计的可靠性。

Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a
single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained
in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information
in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the
estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable
pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form
of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on
closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information
in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well
a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according
to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and
an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original
estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking
methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss
computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit
indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with
explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of
different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate
that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the
goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes
established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions
that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic
pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of
distributed scatterers.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are poised to seamlessly integrate communication,
computing, localization, and sensing functionalities, ensuring high reliability
and trustworthiness. This paper introduces Smart Sensing Feedback (SSF), a
limited-feedback framework designed to enhance sensing capabilities while
maintaining communication performance. SSF adapts the concept of retransmission
from communication to sensing. Specifically, we focus on downlink (DL) bistatic
sensing, where the User Equipment (UE) performs measurements from reflected
sensing signals and provides feedback to the network (NW). In sensing services,
UE reporting can vary significantly due to dynamic factors such as target
characteristics, environmental conditions, and UE status. Our results
demonstrate that SSF significantly improves sensing quality while preserving
communication efficiency. Additionally, it enhances key performance metrics
such as probability of detection, latency, and power consumption. These
improvements underscore SSF's ability to deliver robust, low-overhead feedback
and adaptability to support a wide range of ISAC applications.

Abstract: Digital metasurfaces have attracted significant attention in recent years due
to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves for secure sensing
and communication. However, most reported metasurfaces operate at relatively
high frequencies, primarily due to the constraints imposed by the physical
scale of the dielectric substrate, thus limiting their full-wave system
applications. In this work, a wideband digital reflective metasurface is
presented for capable of dynamically controlling EM waves, with multifunctional
applications in the lower-frequency S-band. The metasurface is composed of
electronically reconfigurable meta-atoms with wideband characteristics, and
designed by using trapezoidal and M-shaped patches connected by a pin diode.
Simulation results show that the proposed digital metasurface could achieve
wideband 1-bit phase quantization with a stable phase difference within 180
degree +/- 25 degree and small reflection loss below 0.6 dB from 2.72 to 3.25
GHz. To validate the proposed design, a 20x20-unit metasurface array was
designed, simulated and fabricated. By dynamically adjusting the coding
sequence, the metasurface could enable multi-mode orbital angular momentum
(OAM) beam generation, dynamic beam scanning, and precise direction finding.
These capabilities support secure sensing and secure communications through
high-resolution target detection and anti-jamming beam steering, as well as
physical-layer security. The proposed wideband metasurface may serve as an
effective candidate for enhancing spectral efficiency and security performance
in radar and wireless systems.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于共现学习的大规模图像下采样方法LSID，通过数据驱动的共现配置文件来保持图像的结构和感知信息，在8倍和16倍下采样时能获得高质量结果。


<details>

Motivation: 现代显示技术和可视化工具需要大规模下采样图像，但现有方法在大规模下采样时容易丢失纹理和边缘细节，导致图像质量下降。

Method: 使用共现学习技术，通过输入图像创建数据驱动的共现配置文件，捕捉邻近区域强度相关性的频率，作为内容自适应范围核来指导精炼滤波过程。每个输入像素的贡献基于其与邻居的成对强度值的相似度。

Result: 在DIV2K、BSD100、Urban100和RealSR数据集上验证，在DIV2K数据集上获得最高39.22 dB PSNR和26.35 PIQE。实验表明该方法在视觉质量和性能指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LSID方法能够在大规模图像下采样时有效保持高频结构（如边缘、纹理和重复模式），减少传统下采样技术中常见的混叠和模糊伪影。

Abstract: In modern display technology and visualization tools, downscaling images is
one of the most important activities. This procedure aims to maintain both
visual authenticity and structural integrity while reducing the dimensions of
an image at a large scale to fit the dimension of the display devices. In this
study, we proposed a new technique for downscaling images that uses
co-occurrence learning to maintain structural and perceptual information while
reducing resolution. The technique uses the input image to create a data-driven
co-occurrence profile that captures the frequency of intensity correlations in
nearby neighborhoods. A refined filtering process is guided by this profile,
which acts as a content-adaptive range kernel. The contribution of each input
pixel is based on how closely it resembles pair-wise intensity values with it's
neighbors. We validate our proposed technique on four datasets: DIV2K, BSD100,
Urban100, and RealSR to show its effective downscaling capacity. Our technique
could obtain up to 39.22 dB PSNR on the DIV2K dataset and PIQE up to 26.35 on
the same dataset when downscaling by 8x and 16x, respectively. Numerous
experimental findings attest to the ability of the suggested picture
downscaling method to outperform more contemporary approaches in terms of both
visual quality and performance measures. Unlike most existing methods, which
did not focus on the large-scale image resizing scenario, we achieve
high-quality downscaled images without texture loss or edge blurring. Our
method, LSID (large scale image downscaling), successfully preserves
high-frequency structures like edges, textures, and repeating patterns by
focusing on statistically consistent pixels while reducing aliasing and
blurring artifacts that are typical of traditional downscaling techniques.

Abstract: The inverse source problem arising in photoacoustic tomography and in several
other coupled-physics modalities is frequently solved by iterative algorithms.
Such algorithms are based on the minimization of a certain cost functional. In
addition, novel deep learning techniques are currently being investigated to
further improve such optimization approaches. All such methods require multiple
applications of the operator defining the forward problem, and of its adjoint.
In this paper, we present new asymptotically fast algorithms for numerical
evaluation of the forward and adjoint operators, applicable in the circular
acquisition geometry. For an $(n \times n)$ image, our algorithms compute these
operators in $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ floating point operations. We
demonstrate the performance of our algorithms in numerical simulations, where
they are used as an integral part of several iterative image reconstruction
techniques: classic variational methods, such as non-negative least squares and
total variation regularized least squares, as well as deep learning methods,
such as learned primal dual. A Python implementation of our algorithms and
computational examples is available to the general public.

Abstract: Identifying and suppressing streaking artifacts is one of the most
challenging problems in quantitative susceptibility mapping. The measured phase
from tissue magnetization is assumed to be the convolution by the magnetic
dipole kernel; direct inversion or standard regularization methods tend to
create streaking artifacts in the estimated susceptibility. This is caused by
extreme noise and by the presence of non-dipolar phase contributions, which are
amplified by the dipole kernel following the streaking pattern. In this work,
we introduce a multiscale transform, called Dipole-lets, as an optimal
decomposition method for identifying dipole incompatibilities in measured field
data by extracting features of different characteristic size and orientation
with respect to the dipole kernel's zero-valued double-cone surface (the magic
cone). We provide experiments that showcase that non-dipolar content can be
extracted by Dipole-lets from phase data through artifact localization. We also
present implementations of Dipole-lets as a optimization functional
regularizator, through simple Tikhonov and infinity norm.

Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently gained attention as a
paradigm for wave-domain signal processing with reduced reliance on costly
radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, conventional SIMs rely on uniform
inter-layer spacing and require deep stacking to ensure processing capability,
resulting in severe power attenuation in practice. To address this issue, we
propose a flexible intelligent layered metasurface (FILM) architecture
consisting of two shape-controllable flexible metasurface layers. By replacing
rigid metasurfaces with flexible ones in both layers, the transmission
coefficient matrix can be dynamically adjusted, significantly decreasing the
number of required layers while maintaining signal processing performance.
Firstly, we develop a two-layer FILM-assisted multi-user multiple-input
single-output (MU-MISO) system, wherein we formulate a channel fitting problem
aimed at reducing the difference between the FILM-induced and target channels.
Then, we solve this non-convex problem by employing an alternating optimization
(AO) method, featuring closed-form phase shift updates and a gradient
descent-based shape optimization. Furthermore, we analyze the upper bound on
sum-rate and the complexity of computation to provide insights into design
trade-offs. Finally, simulation results demonstrated that the proposed
transmissive FILM architecture achieves over 200\% improvement in sum-rate and
more than 7 dB bit-error rate (BER) gain compared to the conventional
seven-layer SIMs.

Result: 证明了最佳可恢复集是x* + ker(U)，其中U是所有可能删除2q行后的子矩阵行空间交集的投影矩阵。同时证明了所有最小化ℓ0范数的解都在这个集合中。

Conclusion: 该工作为在稀疏对抗性噪声下从线性测量中恢复信号提供了理论保证，确定了最大可恢复信息集，并给出了构造性恢复方法，解决了任意矩阵和信号情况下的可恢复性问题。

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix
and $\mathbf{e}$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $\mathbf{y} =
\mathbf{A} x^* + \mathbf{e}$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing
$x^*$-hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^*$-that is uniformly
recoverable from $\mathbf{y}$ without knowing $\mathbf{e}$. While exact
recovery of $x^*$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on
$\mathbf{A}$ or $x^*$ (for example, restricted isometry, sparsity) is well
studied, recoverability for arbitrary $\mathbf{A}$ and $x^*$ remains open. Our
main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^* +
\ker(\mathbf{U})$, where $\mathbf{U}$ is the unique projection matrix onto the
intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $\mathbf{A}$ obtained
by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the
$\ell_0$-norm of $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{A} x$ lies in $x^* + \ker(\mathbf{U})$,
which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.

Abstract: Interference management is a central bottleneck in dense multi-antenna
wireless networks. Therefore, in this study, we present a digital
precoding-free hierarchical rate-splitting multiple access (HRSMA) architecture
assisted by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to achieve high spectral
efficiency and user fairness with reduced hardware complexity. In the proposed
system, the base station performs only scalar power allocation, while a
multi-layer SIM acts as a wave-domain processor that spatially separates users
and mitigates interference via nonlinear wavefront reconfiguration. This design
eliminates the need for digital or hybrid precoding, drastically reducing the
baseband computations. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize
the minimum user rate by jointly optimizing SIM phase shifts, power allocation,
and user grouping. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, an
alternating optimization algorithm is developed, combining simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) for SIM configuration and power
control with clustering-based grouping refinement. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed SIM-aided HRSMA achieves substantial gains in
both spectral efficiency and fairness compared to hybrid beamforming and
non-precoding baselines. Specifically, SIM-aided HRSMA attains comparable or
superior minimum rates with significantly fewer active antennas by exploiting
the additional wave-domain degrees of freedom provided by multi-layer SIMs.
These findings highlight the potential of SIM-aided HRSMA as a low-cost,
energy-efficient, and scalable solution for beyond-6G networks.

Abstract: Targeting the requirements of 6G, this paper investigates a semi-passive
dual-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) system, tackling the max-min user
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) problem via joint active and
passive beamforming to enhance system performance and ensure user fairness.
Addressing this challenge, we first utilize dual RISs for user angle estimation
to simplify the solution process of the formulated problem, an efficient
alternating optimization algorithm is then developed. Specifically,
semi-definite relaxation and the bisection method are employed to solve the
transmit beamforming optimization subproblem. For the RIS discrete phase
shifts, a sensing-assisted approach is adopted to constrain the optimization
search space, with two distinct low-complexity search strategies introduced for
different RIS sizes. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves performance close to the ideal continuous phase shift
benchmark, outperforms conventional discrete phase shift optimization
algorithms, and exhibits a significant improvement over single-RIS systems.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks,
existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL)
are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot
generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns
rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These
limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with
high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these
limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning
framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of
information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive
psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven
System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and
logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over
reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end
differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended
horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment
interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model
can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals
without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient
decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based
on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with
material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model
achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong
generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the
state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.

Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy
capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded
modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output
feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned
feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We
study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage,
illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between
legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our
findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication,
to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.
