We describe the methodology for mapping the\niterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose\ndifferent methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is\nproposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball\nwith a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for\nreinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to\nimprove the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list\ndecoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values\nthat substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism\ngroup of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose\na feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing\nhigh-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after\nthe existing decoders.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep learning-based Position-domain Channel Extrapolation\nframework (named PCEnet) for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. The user's position, which contains significant channel\ncharacteristic information, can greatly enhance the efficiency of channel\nacquisition. In cell-free massive MIMO, while the propagation environments\nbetween different base stations and a specific user vary and their respective\nchannels are uncorrelated, the user's position remains constant and unique\nacross all channels. Building on this, the proposed PCEnet framework leverages\nthe position as a bridge between channels to establish a mapping between the\ncharacteristics of different channels, thereby using one acquired channel to\nassist in the estimation and feedback of others. Specifically, this approach\nfirst utilizes neural networks (NNs) to infer the user's position from the\nobtained channel. {The estimated position, shared among BSs through a central\nprocessing unit (CPU)}, is then fed into an NN to design pilot symbols and\nconcatenated with the feedback information to the channel reconstruction NN to\nreconstruct other channels, thereby significantly enhancing channel acquisition\nperformance. Additionally, we propose a simplified strategy where only the\nestimated position is used in the reconstruction process without modifying the\npilot design, thereby reducing latency. Furthermore, we introduce a position\nlabel-free approach that infers the relative user position instead of the\nabsolute position, eliminating the need for ground truth position labels during\nthe localization NN training.

This work\nfocuses on accurately estimating and correcting timing offsets (TOs) and\ncarrier frequency offsets (CFOs). Specifically, TO estimation is essential for\nlocating users' pilots on the delay-time plane, while CFO estimation enhances\nchannel estimation accuracy. First, we propose a TO estimation technique for an\nexisting multiuser pilot structure in MU-OTFS. We replace the impulse pilot\n(IMP) in this pilot structure with a more practical pilot with a cyclic prefix\n(PCP), referred to as single-user-inspired PCP (SU-PCP). This structure employs\ndifferent Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, which enables pilot separation via\ncorrelation at the receiver side. Consequently, we introduce a\ncorrelation-based TO estimation technique for uplink MU-OTFS using this pilot\nstructure. Next, a spectrally efficient and practical pilot pattern is\nproposed, where each user transmits a PCP within a shared pilot region on the\ndelay-Doppler plane, referred to as MU-PCP. At the receiver, the second TO\nestimation technique utilizes a bank of filters to separate different users'\nsignals and accurately estimate their TOs. Then, we derive a mathematical\nthreshold range to enhance TO estimation accuracy by finding the first major\npeak in the correlation function rather than relying solely on the highest\npeak. After locating the received users' pilot signals using one of the\nproposed TO estimation techniques, our proposed CFO estimation technique\nreduces the multi-dimensional maximum likelihood (ML) search problem into\nmultiple one-dimensional search problems. In this technique, we apply the\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind basis expansion model (CPF-BEM) to\neffectively handle the time-variations of the channel in obtaining the CFO\nestimates for all the users.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0a\u884c\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u540c\u6b65\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9a\u65f6\u504f\u79fb\uff08TO\uff09\u548c\u8f7d\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff08CFO\uff09\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6821\u6b63TO\u548cCFO\u5bf9\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fTO\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7528\u6237\u5bfc\u9891\uff0cCFO\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u7528\u6237\u542f\u53d1\u7684PCP\uff08SU-PCP\uff09\u5bfc\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfIMP\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540cZC\u5e8f\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bfc\u9891\u5206\u79bb\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684TO\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u5171\u4eab\u5bfc\u9891\u533a\u57df\u7684MU-PCP\u5bfc\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7ec4\u5206\u79bb\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1TO\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eChebyshev\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684CFO\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u7ef4ML\u641c\u7d22\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u4e00\u7ef4\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TO\u548cCFO\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u540c\u6b65\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237OTFS\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u540c\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Due\nto the limitations of physically moving radiating elements, electronically\nreconfigurable antennas are emerging as practical implementations of FASs,\nsince changing the radiation pattern is functionally equivalent to physically\nmoving the device. However, electronically reconfigurable antennas pose a\nchallenge in terms of analytical modeling, often requiring full-wave\nsimulations or measurements for their characterization; this severely limits\nthe extraction of theoretical insights useful for system design. Motivated by\nthese difficulties and the growing interest in FASs, we propose in this paper a\ncomplete analytical model for metasurface-based embodiments of FASs.\nSpecifically, we advocate for the implementation of the FAS concept through\ndynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), hitherto proposed as array replacements in\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We leverage circuit theory to\nrewrite the conventional signal model of FASs in terms of admittance matrices\naccounting for the electromagnetic effects inherent to metasurfaces.

In this study, we used\nin-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of\nfour different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over\ntwo growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N\nconcentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level.

The\ncomparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets\nshowed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection\nmethods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level\ndatasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,\nand 900-950nm.

We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator\nand aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance\nsubject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely\nthe Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to\nquantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter\nand the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal\ntransmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process\n(CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture\npolicy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies\nwith a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a\ntransmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both\nthe AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient\nconditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold\npolicy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors.\nLeveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm,\nInsec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead.\nOur results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields\nsignificantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric\nalone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528MAP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548cAoCE\u3001AoI\u4e24\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5Insec-SPI\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f20\u8f93\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\uff08MAP\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AoCE\u548cAoI\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e26\u65e0\u754c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08CMDP\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5Insec-SPI\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408AoI\u548cAoCE\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

An axial\ndiffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a\ncoronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining\nperpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data\nefficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric\nconsistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image\ninpainting.

Expanding upon the\ntheoretical framework of DPE noise variance through geometric analysis, this\npaper focuses on a geometric representation of multipath errors by quantifying\nthe deviations in CAF and PVT solutions caused by off-centering bias relative\nto the azimuth and elevation angles. A satellite circular multipath bias (SCMB)\nmodel is introduced, amalgamating CAF and PVT errors from multiple satellite\nchannels. The boundaries for maximum or minimum PVT bias are established\nthrough discussions encompassing various multipath conditions. The correctness\nof the multipath geometrical portrait is confirmed through both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and urban canyon tests. The findings indicate that the maximum PVT\nbias depends on the largest multipath errors observed across various satellite\nchannels. Additionally, the PVT bias increases with satellite elevation angles,\ninfluenced by the CAF multipath bias projection.

The inherent randomness in\ndiffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical\nimages and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a\npromising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current\ntraining and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven\ndistribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer\ntraining times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a\nnovel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a\nunified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces\na staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction\ntargets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention\nacross all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through\npre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate\nperformance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal\npathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:\npervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision\nlanguage models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,\nwhile the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs\ndifficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address\nthese issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset\ncontaining both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and\npropose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification\nand anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture\nimage specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.\nFurthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine\ntuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning\nquality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology\nreport generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation\nquality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance.
