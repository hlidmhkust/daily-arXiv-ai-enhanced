To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to\nhigher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT),\ngyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However,\nexisting 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical\nuniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D\nnon-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a\nconsistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD),\nwhich is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in\ntime-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in\npractical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical\nimaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise.

Although\nrecent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods\nrequire large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from\nsubstantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new\nsamples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST\nthat couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample\ndomain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D\nsampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while\nother sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing\nvolumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we\npropose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate\nfully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only\nsample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain\ndiscrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that\nfirst aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates\ndense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast\nMulti-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the\nadjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of\nParameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a\nConfidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their\nestimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression\nprediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while\nsubstantially reducing the measurement burden.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-DAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u6b21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72.5D\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u5168\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282.5D\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5168\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u76f8\u90bb\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d2\u503c\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4f2a\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u591a\u57df\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u3002", "result": "ST-DAI\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5168\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-DAI\u4e3a3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u5ec9\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper tackles this optimization when the\ncommunication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis\nof the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a\nmacrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be\nsignificant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,\ndemonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a\nclosed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS\nelements and/or the channel coherence grow large.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316PDPR\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RIS\u5143\u7d20\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136PDPR\u5728\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u9053\u7edf\u8ba1\u8c03\u6574RIS\u76f8\u79fb\uff0c\u4f18\u5316PDPR\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b8f\u8702\u7a9d\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316PDPR\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728RIS\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316PDPR\u5728RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RIS\u6216\u9ad8\u4fe1\u9053\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of\nGaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver\ninformation symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the\ntarget's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by\nprocessing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the\nsequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the\ninformation signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of\nthe information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive\nthe corresponding Cram\\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose\npractical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we\nformulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to\nminimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.\nWhen the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting\nbeamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an\noptimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic\nsensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a\nlocally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex\napproximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing\nGaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for\ntarget sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior\nISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684CRB\uff0c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u901a\u4fe1\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6700\u4f4eSINR\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u53cc\u57fa\u5730ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86DoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684CRB\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSCA\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728ISAC\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
