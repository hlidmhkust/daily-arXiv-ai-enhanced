However, mmWave signals suffer from their inherent characteristics\nsuch as severe path loss, poor scattering, and limited diffraction, which\nnecessitate the use of large antenna arrays and directional beamforming,\ntypically implemented through massive MIMO architectures. Accurate channel\nestimation is critical in such systems, but its computational complexity\nincreases proportionally with the number of antennas. This may become a\nsignificant burden in mmWave systems where channels exhibit rapid fluctuations\nand require frequent updates. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity\nchannel denoiser based on Bayesian binary hypothesis testing and beamspace\nsparsity. By modeling each sparse beamspace component as a mixture of signal\nand noise under a Bernoulli-complex Gaussian prior, we formulate a likelihood\nratio test to detect signal-relevant elements.

The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first\nexplicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of\nmultipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced\ncyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the\nextra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are\npresented theoretically.

We design the change-guided\nresidual refinement (CGRR) Branch, which focuses on extending shallow texture\nfeatures to multiple scale features obtained from PVT, enabling early attention\nand acquisition of special colors. Then, channel spatial attention is used in\nthe deep features to achieve independent information enhancement. Additionally,\nwe construct the global cross correlation module (GCCM) to facilitate semantic\ninformation interaction between bi-temporal images, establishing building and\ntarget recognition relationships between different images. Further semantic\nfeature enhancement is achieved through the semantic cognitive enhancement\nmodule (SCEM), and finally, the cross fusion decoder (CFD) is used for change\ninformation fusion and image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on three\npublic datasets demonstrate that our CGCCE-Net outperforms mainstream BCD\nmethods with outstanding performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCGCCE-Net\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08BCD\uff09\u4e2d\u7279\u6b8a\u989c\u8272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7279\u6b8a\u989c\u8272\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86CGRR\u5206\u652f\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0cGCCM\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0cSCEM\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caCFD\u6a21\u5757\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCGCCE-Net\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41BCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "CGCCE-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u5757\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, insufficient exploration of diffusion\nMRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In\nthis work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning\nNetwork (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our\nDCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber\ntractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels\nannotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder\nModule (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and\ndiffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human\nConnectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared\nto single-label network.

We\nimplemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from\n124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then\nfine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health\nSystem using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based\non tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,\nCP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional\ncomponents. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,\nconvLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a\nmulti-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard\nUnet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods\nshowing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable\nperformance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.\nOver-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance\nthan strictly low-rank adaptations.

Recent conditional coding methods propagate\nimplicit temporal information for inter-frame coding, demonstrating superior\ncoding performance to those relying exclusively on previously decoded frames\n(i.e. the explicit temporal information). However, these methods require\nsubstantial memory to store a large number of implicit features. This work\npresents a hybrid buffering strategy. For inter-frame coding, it buffers one\npreviously decoded frame as the explicit temporal reference and a small number\nof learned features as implicit temporal reference.

In this work, we address both\nsegmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI\ndataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage\ntraining strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels\nusing the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned\nfeatures to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen\nvalidation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of\n0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR\nclassification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic\nfeatures extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast\nDCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\\%, and up to 75\\% in some\nsubgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive\nfields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on\nadvanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further\nimprove performance and generalization.

In orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based\nframeworks, conventional pilot allocation schemes face a trade-off between\nspectral efficiency (SE) and sensing performance. Interleaved pilots improve\nuser equipment (UE) multiplexing through sparse allocation but reduce the\nmaximum unambiguous range. Conversely, orthogonal block-based pilots reduce\nrange ambiguity but degrade sensing resolution due to limited delay\ngranularity. To address this trade-off, the phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) scheme\nwas recently proposed for uplink multiple access in ISAC systems. However,\nPS-ISAC suffers from spectral inefficiency due to the fixed cyclic prefix (CP)\nconstraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose adaptive\nphase-shifted-ISAC (APS-ISAC), an enhanced pilot scheme that employs an\noverlapped block-pilot structure with UE-specific phase shifts determined by\nmaximum excess delay of each UE. This design enables UEs to share the same\ntime-frequency resources while preserving separable and contiguous channel\nimpulse responses (CIRs) at the base station (BS).

We introduce REACT-KD, a\nRegion-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that\ntransfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a\nlightweight CT-based student model.

In\ncontrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker\nexpression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly\nand time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To\naddress this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising\nalternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of\nsynthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving\nstructural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this\nend, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and\nevaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining\nrestoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image\nrestoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,\nStar-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker\nvariability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC\npatches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a\nclinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic\ndegradation based on biomarker classification accuracy.

Integrating\ncomplementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation\naccuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods\nface several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities\nhinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack\nadaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are\ndecoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a\ndual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature\nalignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal\n3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network\nto process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign\nmodule between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention\nmechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a\nreinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that\nconsistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features\nare then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an\nensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from\nindividual patches to produce the final segmentation result.
