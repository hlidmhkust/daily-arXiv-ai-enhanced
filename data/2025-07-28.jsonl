Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the\nspectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple\nfrequencies when utilizing spectral excitation.

The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity\nmaps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with\nhyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI.

The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity. This class of networks has\nbeen intensely studied in the information theoretic literature, where several\napproximated or exact (under certain conditions) capacity results have been\nderived.

As\nwireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and\nstandardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development,\nevaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to\ndevelop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1\nGHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave\nbands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency\nrange, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved\na Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several\nenhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a\nSuburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,\nvariability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per\ncluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all\npolarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)\neffects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper\npresents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying\nrationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and\nenhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models."}

In this paper, we propose a novel method with open-source\ncodes for generating RIS-assisted RSS fingerprint databases. Our method\ncaptures the complex RIS-assisted multipath behaviors by extended cluster-based\nchannel modeling and the physical and electromagnetic properties of RIS and\ntransmitter (Tx). And the spatial consistency is incorporated when simulating\nthe fingerprint data collection across neighboring positions. Furthermore, the\nproposed method offers exceptional flexibility in configuring RIS and Tx\nparameters. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the fingerprint\ndatabase generated by the proposed method. Moreover, the positioning\nperformance on the database using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) is analyzed, providing valuable insights for the system design."}

To address this gap, we present a framework for structured\nmeasurements that are generated by random orbits of a group representation\nassociated with a finite group. We differentiate between two scenarios: one in\nwhich the sampling set is fixed and another in which the sampling set is\nrandomized. For each case, we derive an estimate for the number of measurements\nrequired to ensure that the restricted isometry property holds with high\nprobability. These estimates are contingent upon the specific representation\nemployed. For this reason, we analyze and characterize various representations\nthat yield favorable recovery outcomes, including the left regular\nrepresentation. Our work not only establishes a comprehensive framework for\nsparse recovery of group-structured measurements but also generalizes\nestablished measurement schemes, such as those derived from partial random\ncirculant matrices."}

Force plates (FP) are considered the gold\nstandard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their\nlack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their\nwidespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel\nBalance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical\nfibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human\nstudy. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled\nsway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human\nstudy, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in\ncombination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway\nmean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,\nand sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability\nwas evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values\ngreater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were\nconsidered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent\nICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed\nmoderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman\nplots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the\nFP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was\nused to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated\nconsistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both\nreliability and validity following appropriate calibration."}

Different from prior works on 6DMA design which use\nalternating optimization to iteratively update surface positions and rotations,\nwe propose a new sequential optimization method that first determines the\noptimal rotations and then identifies feasible positions to realize these\nrotations under practical antenna placement constraints.

To address this issue, we, in this paper,\npropose a randomized alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)\nalgorithm for large-scale MMB problems. We first propose a novel formulation\nthat transforms the highly challenging feasibility-checking problem into a\nlinearly constrained optimization problem. An efficient randomized ADMM is then\ndeveloped for solving the linearly constrained problem. Unlike standard ADMM,\nrandomized ADMM only needs to solve a small number of subproblems at each\niteration to ensure convergence, thus achieving a substantial complexity\nreduction. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm\nexhibits an O(1/\\bar{t}) convergence rate (\\bar{t} represents the number of\niterations), which is on the same order as its deterministic counterpart.\nNumerical results show that the proposed algorithm offers a significant\ncomplexity advantage over existing methods in solving the MMB problem."}

This makes\nsuch an attack one of the most feasible approaches to carrying out collusion.\nIn order to trace all the colluders, several types of multimedia fingerprinting\ncodes were introduced to construct fingerprints resistant to averaging attacks\non multimedia contents, such as AND anti-collusion codes (AND-ACCs), binary\nseparable codes (SCs), logical anti-collusion codes (LACCs), binary frameproof\ncodes (FPCs), binary strongly-separable codes (SSCs) and binary secure code\nwith list decoding (SCLDs). Then codes with the rate as high as possible are\ndesired. However, the existing fingerprinting codes have low code rate due to\nthe strong combinatorial structure. The reason is that the previous research\nmethods adopted simple tracing algorithms. In this paper, we first propose\nnovel tracing algorithms and then find appropriate fingerprinting codes with\nweaker combinatorial structure, i.e., the binary strongly identifiable parent\nproperty code for multimedia fingerprinting (SMIPPC) and its concatenated code.\nTheoretical comparisons and numerical comparisons show that SMIPPCs have higher\ncode rates than those of the existing codes due to their weaker combinatorial\nstructures. It is worth noting that SMIPPCs can only trace a part of colluders\nby using the previous tracing algorithm and the concatenated SMIPPC may be not\nan SMIPPC. This implies that our tracing algorithms have strong traceability."}

To\nevaluate the introduced metrics, we considered a high-fidelity digital twin\nmodel of an area of Milan, Italy and we enriched it with two different types of\nenvironmental changes: (i) the inclusion of parked vehicles meshes, and (ii)\nthe segmentation of the buildings facade faces to separate the windows mesh\ncomponents from the rest of the building.
