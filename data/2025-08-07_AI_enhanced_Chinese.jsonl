It encourages trust and helps in further\nclinical validation.

However, aligning\nmedical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high\nSNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this\npaper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment\neffectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level\nvision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to\ndifferentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical\nstructure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling\nmethod to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging\nVQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This\nprocess amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in\nabnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of\nabnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures\nthe diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate\nalignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two\nchest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,\nMedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across\nmultiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot performance.

Existing linear CI-based\nprecoding methods, including symbol-level precoding (SLP) and block-level\nprecoding (BLP), suffer from performance limitations due to strict symbol-level\npower budgets or insufficient degrees of freedom over the block. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose a nonlinear waveform optimization framework that\nintroduces additional optimization variables and maximizes the minimum CI\nmetric across the transmission block. The optimal waveform is derived in closed\nform using the function and Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, and the solution is\nexplicitly expressed with respect to the dual variables. Moreover, the original\nproblems are equivalently reformulated as tractable quadratic programming (QP)\nproblems. To efficiently solve the derived QP problems, we develop an improved\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm by integrating a\nlinear-time projection technique, which significantly enhances the\ncomputational efficiency.

Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet\ntheir manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent\nadvancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in\nmedical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report\ngeneration. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have\npredominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique\ncharacteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To\nbridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET\nimages. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report\ngeneration with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body\nimage-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in\nexisting benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness.

A main challenge when building a digital\nUE combining is the large volume of baseband samples to handle. To mitigate\ncomputational and hardware complexity, we propose a novel two-stage digital\ncombining scheme at the UE. The first stage reduces the $N_{\\text{r}}$ received\nsignals to $N_{\\text{c}}$ streams before baseband processing, leveraging\nchannel geometry for dimension reduction and updating at the beam coherence\ntime, which is longer than the channel coherence time of the small-scale\nfading. By contrast, the second-stage combining is updated per fading\nrealization. We develop a pilot-based channel estimation framework for this\nhardware setup based on maximum likelihoodestimation in both uplink and\ndownlink.

However, most existing\nmethods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their\ngeneralizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents\nTotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple\nanatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a\nnovel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only\n11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we\nconstructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body\n(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at\ndifferent time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic\nclassical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image\nregistration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated\nour model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal\ndatasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal\ndataset from a collaborating hospital.

Since the\nwidely deployed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform\nsuffers from subcarrier orthogonality loss under severe Doppler spread,\ndelay-Doppler domain multi-carrier (DDMC) modulation systems, such as\northogonal time frequency space (OTFS), have been extensively studied. While\nOTFS can exploit time-frequency (TF) domain channel diversity, it faces\nchallenges including high receiver complexity and inflexible TF resource\nallocation, making OFDM still the most promising waveform for 6G. In this\narticle, we propose a DD domain signal processing-aided OFDM (DD-a-OFDM) scheme\nto enhance OFDM performance based on DDMC research insights. First, we design a\nDD-a-OFDM system structure, retaining the classical OFDM transceiver while\nincorporating DD domain channel estimation and TF domain equalization. Second,\nwe detail DD domain channel estimation using discrete TF pilots and prove that\nTF domain inter-carrier interference (ICI) could be transformed into DD domain\nGaussian interference. Third, we derive closed-form Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds\n(CRLBs) for DD domain channel estimation. Fourth, we develop maximum likelihood\n(ML) and peak detection-based channel estimators, along with a corresponding TF\ndomain equalizer.

Existing research on FAS primarily\nfocuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the\nsituations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS\ncommunication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with\namplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy\nconsumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we\nformulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the\npositions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve\ncontrollable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage\nwhich causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly\nconsiders the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale\nfading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position,\nFA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints,\nand propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization\nproblem.

The method was benchmarked against non\nprobabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic\nnetwork with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed\non synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in\nvivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed\nusing calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous\nRanked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper\npredictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight\noverconfidence was observed in D*.

The framework supports 2D and 3D positioning using received\nsignal strength (RSS) from pilot transmissions, enhanced by the radical axis\ntheorem to improve accuracy under measurement uncertainties. Communication is\nachieved using spatial modulation (SM) with M-ary pulse amplitude modulation\n(PAM), where data is conveyed through the modulation symbol and the active\nlight-emitting diode (LED) index, improving spectral efficiency while\nmaintaining low complexity. A pilot-aided least squares (LS) estimator is\nemployed for joint channel and dimming coefficient estimation, enabling robust\nsymbol detection in multipath environments characterized by both line-of-sight\n(LOS) and diffuse non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components, modeled using Rician\nfading. The proposed system incorporates a dimming control mechanism to meet\nlighting requirements while maintaining reliable communication and positioning\nperformance. Simulation results demonstrate sub-centimeter localization\naccuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and bit error rates (BERs) below\n10^{-6} for low-order PAM schemes. Additionally, comparative analysis across\nuser locations reveals that positioning and communication performance improve\nsignificantly near the geometric center of the LED layout. These findings\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed system for future 6G indoor networks\nrequiring integrated localization and communication under practical channel\nconditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\uff08VLC\uff09\u7684\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08JCP\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea62D\u548c3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\uff08SM\uff09\u548cM\u8fdb\u5236\u8109\u51b2\u5e45\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\uff08PAM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u5ba4\u5185\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96c6\u6210\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08RSS\uff09\u548c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f74\u5b9a\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8c03\u5236\u548cPAM\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u4e9a\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4f4e\u4e8e10^{-6}\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728LED\u5e03\u5c40\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9644\u8fd1\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u57286G\u5ba4\u5185\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}
