However, the inherent sparsity of tumors and their morphological diversity lead to obvious heterogeneity across regions, posing significant challenges in aggregating high-quality and discriminative representations. To address this, we introduce a novel concept of anchor instance (AI), a compact subset of instances that are representative within their regions (local) and discriminative at the bag (global) level. These AIs act as semantic references to guide interactions across regions, correcting non-discriminative patterns while preserving regional diversity. Specifically, we propose a dual-level anchor mining (DAM) module to \\textbf{select} AIs from massive instances, where the most informative AI in each region is extracted by assessing its similarity to both local and global embeddings. Furthermore, to ensure completeness and diversity, we devise an anchor-guided region correction (ARC) module that explores the complementary information from all regions to \\textbf{correct} each regional representation. Building upon DAM and ARC, we develop a concise yet effective framework, AINet, which employs a simple predictor and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with substantially fewer FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, both DAM and ARC are modular and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MIL frameworks, consistently improving their performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "AINet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u951a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u951a\u70b9\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u80bf\u7624\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u805a\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u951a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e14\u5168\u5c40\u6709\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53cc\u7ea7\u951a\u70b9\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u951a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u533a\u57df\u6821\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u6821\u6b63\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u8868\u793a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u4e86AINet\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "AINet\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11FLOPs\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002DAM\u548cARC\u6a21\u5757\u662f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684MIL\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AINet\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u951a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u533a\u57df\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Materials and Methods: This retrospective multi-dataset study developed nnU-Net models on BraTS 2021 (n=848) and externally tested them on UPenn-GBM glioblastoma MRI (n=403; 2006-2018; age 18-89 years; 60% male). Models were trained with no dropout or targeted T2-FLAIR dropout (probability rate r=0.35 or 0.50) by replacing only the T2-FLAIR channel with zeros. Inference used T2-FLAIR-present and T2-FLAIR-absent scenarios (T2-FLAIR set to zero). The primary endpoint was Dice similarity coefficient (DSC); secondary endpoints were 95th percentile Hausdorff distance and Bland-Altman whole-tumor volume bias. Equivalence was assessed with two one-sided tests using +/-1.5 DSC percentage points, and noninferiority versus HD-GLIO used a -1.5-point margin. Results: With T2-FLAIR present, median overall DSC was 94.8% (interquartile range, 90.0%-97.1%) with dropout and 95.0% (interquartile range, 90.3%-97.1%) without dropout (equivalence supported, p<0.001). With T2-FLAIR absent, median overall DSC improved from 81.0% (interquartile range, 75.1%-86.4%) without dropout to 93.4% (interquartile range, 89.1%-96.2%) with dropout (r=0.35); edema DSC improved from 14.0% to 87.0%, edema 95th percentile Hausdorff distance improved from 22.44 mm to 2.45 mm, and whole-tumor volume bias improved from -45.6 mL to 0.83 mL. Dropout was noninferior to HD-GLIO under T2-FLAIR-present (all p<0.001).

This paper introduces a progressive pipeline integrating DEFOM-Stereo foundation-model disparity estimation, SAM3 instance segmentation, and multi-stage depth optimization to deliver robust per-branch point clouds. Starting from a naive baseline, we systematically identify and resolve three error families through successive refinements. Mask boundary contamination is first addressed through morphological erosion and subsequently refined via a skeleton-preserving variant to safeguard thin-branch topology. Segmentation inaccuracy is then mitigated using LAB-space Mahalanobis color validation coupled with cross-branch overlap arbitration. Finally, depth noise - the most persistent error source - is initially reduced by outlier removal and median filtering, before being superseded by a robust five-stage scheme comprising MAD global detection, spatial density consensus, local MAD filtering, RGB-guided filtering, and adaptive bilateral filtering. Evaluated on 1920x1080 stereo imagery of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) acquired with a ZED Mini camera (63 mm baseline) from a UAV in Canterbury, New Zealand, the proposed pipeline reduces the average per-branch depth standard deviation by 82% while retaining edge fidelity.

In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted.

Full version of a work prepared for submission to IEEE", "summary": "In practical Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems, symbol detection remains challenging due to severe inter-user interference and sensitivity to Channel State Information (CSI) uncertainty. In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGNNSIC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684MU-MIMO\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301DeepSIC\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "MU-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684DeepSIC\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DeepSIC\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e3aNetwork-of-MLPs\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5916\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe\u8fde\u63a5\u591a\u4e2aMLP\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51faGNNSIC\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7528\u6237\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "GNNSIC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eDeepSIC\u76f8\u5f53\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u6307\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GNNSIC\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728MU-MIMO\u7b26\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

They are important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science, yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant alphabet size.\n  In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (SICOMP 2006) show how to construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs.\n  In this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting. We prove an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making $2$ queries (even adaptively) over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021) and is the first exponential lower bound for RLDCs. Combined with the results of Ben-Sasson et al., our result exhibits a ``phase-transition''-type behavior on the codeword length for some constant-query complexity.

Micro-Doppler spectrograms derived from FMCW radar signals are central to recognizing dynamic activities, but their effectiveness is limited by noise and clutter. In this work, we use a benchmark radar dataset to reimplement and assess three recent denoising and preprocessing techniques: adaptive preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and entropy-based denoising. To illustrate the shortcomings of conventional metrics in low-SNR regimes, we evaluate performance using both perceptual image quality measures and standard error-based metrics. We additionally propose a novel framework for static activity recognition using range-angle feature maps to expand HAR beyond dynamic activities. We present two important contributions: a temporal tracking algorithm to enforce consistency and a no-reference quality scoring algorithm to assess RA-map fidelity. According to experimental findings, our suggested techniques enhance classification performance and interpretability for both dynamic and static activities, opening the door for more reliable radar-based HAR systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb-\u89d2\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f7\u8fbe\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u8c31\u56fe\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6742\u6ce2\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u52a8\u6001\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1) \u91cd\u65b0\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u53bb\u566a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u53bb\u566a\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb-\u89d2\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u9759\u6001\u6d3b\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u9759\u6001\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Quantifying low-concentration metabolites such as GABA ($\u03b3$-aminobutyric acid) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral overlap. We investigate and validate deep learning for quantifying complex, low-SNR, overlapping signals from MEGA-PRESS spectra, devise a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Y-shaped autoencoder (YAE), and select the best models via Bayesian optimisation on 10,000 simulated spectra from slice-profile-aware MEGA-PRESS simulations. The selected models are trained on 100,000 simulated spectra. We validate their performance on 144 spectra from 112 experimental phantoms containing five metabolites of interest (GABA, Glu, Gln, NAA, Cr) with known ground truth concentrations across solution and gel series acquired at 3 T under varied bandwidths and implementations. These models are further assessed against the widely used LCModel quantification tool. On simulations, both models achieve near-perfect agreement (small MAEs; regression slopes $\\approx 1.00$, $R^2 \\approx 1.00$). On experimental phantom data, errors initially increased substantially. However, modelling variable linewidths in the training data significantly reduced this gap. The best augmented deep learning models achieved a mean MAE for GABA over all phantom spectra of 0.151 (YAE) and 0.160 (FCNN) in max-normalised relative concentrations, outperforming the conventional baseline LCModel (0.220). A sim-to-real gap remains, but physics-informed data augmentation substantially reduced it.

Nevertheless, because communication channels change rapidly, their distributions can shift over time, often making periodic retraining necessary. This paper proposes a zero-overhead online and continual learning framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) neural receivers that directly detect the soft bits of received signals. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods that rely on dedicated training intervals or full resource grids, our approach leverages existing demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to simultaneously enable signal demodulation and model adaptation. We introduce three pilot designs: fully randomized, hybrid, and additional pilots that flexibly support joint demodulation and learning. To accommodate these pilot designs, we develop two receiver architectures: (i) a parallel design that separates inference and fine-tuning for uninterrupted operation, and (ii) a forward-pass reusing design that reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively tracks both slow and fast channel distribution variations without additional overhead, service interruption, or catastrophic performance degradation under distribution shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eOFDM\u795e\u7ecf\u63a5\u6536\u673a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709DMRS\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u53f7\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u8c03\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u95f4\u9694\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u8d44\u6e90\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "DNN\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u5feb\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u95f4\u9694\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u8d44\u6e90\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5bfc\u9891\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u989d\u5916\u5bfc\u9891\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u8c03\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5e76\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u548c\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u590d\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709DMRS\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6162\u901f\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aOFDM\u795e\u7ecf\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a5\u6536\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $\u03b4< \u0394$, additive errors of magnitude at most $\u03b4$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $\u0394$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $\u0394/\u03b4$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$. Moreover, this characterization is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation when the columns of the generator matrix of $C$ all have the same $L_2$ norm. Through examples of several code families, it is demonstrated how the results herein can be used to compute the height profile explicitly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u62df\u5411\u91cf-\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df\u5411\u91cf-\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff1a\u53ef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u2264\u03b4\uff09\u548c\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b/\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u8bef\u5dee\uff08>\u0394\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4ec5\u80fd\u786e\u5b9a\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f16\u7801\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ec4\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801C\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u6709\u9650\u7801\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u6700\u5927\u503c\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927-\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff09\uff1b3. \u5f53\u751f\u6210\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5217\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540cL2\u8303\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5904\u7406\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While classical methods rely on predefined analytical bases like B-splines, implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative that use coordinate-based networks to parameterize continuous functions with implicitly defined bases. Despite their empirical success, direct comparisons of their intrinsic representation capabilities with conventional models remain limited. This preliminary empirical study compares a positional-encoded INR with a cubic B-spline model for continuous function fitting from sparse random samples, isolating the representation capacity difference by only using coefficient-domain Tikhonov regularization. Results demonstrate that, under oracle hyperparameter selection, the INR achieves a lower normalized root-mean-squared error, yielding sharper edge transitions and fewer oscillatory artifacts than the oracle-tuned B-spline model. Additionally, we show that a practical bilevel optimization framework for INR hyperparameter selection based on measurement data split effectively approximates oracle performance. These findings empirically support the superior representation capacity of INRs for sparse data fitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a(INR)\u4e0e\u4e09\u6b21B\u6837\u6761\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0cINR\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u5728MRI\u7b49\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\uff0cINR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5185\u5728\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801INR\u4e0e\u4e09\u6b21B\u6837\u6761\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u6570\u57dfTikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9694\u79bb\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u62df\u5408", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4e0b\uff0cINR\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9510\u5229\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u632f\u8361\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u903c\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301INR\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Under the control of a central processing unit (CPU), multiple access points (APs) collaboratively perform multistatic sensing while providing communication service in a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Achieving high sensing accuracy requires the collection of global sensing information at the CPU, which can lead to significant fronthaul signaling overhead due to the feedback of the sensing signals from each AP. To tackle this issue, we propose a collaborative processing scheme in which the APs locally compress and quantize the received sensing signals before forwarding them to the CPU. The CPU then aggregates the information from all APs to estimate the location and velocity of the targets. We develop a distributed vector-quantized variational autoencoder (D-VQVAE) to enable an end-to-end implementation of this scheme. D-VQVAE consists of distributed encoders at the APs to locally encode the received sensing signals, codebooks for quantizing the encoded results, and a decoder at the CPU for location and velocity estimation. It effectively reduces the amount of data transmitted from each AP to the CPU while maintaining a high sensing accuracy. We employ a collaborative learning-assisted scheme to train D-VQVAE in an end-to-end manner. Simulation results show that the proposed D-VQVAE network outperforms the baseline schemes in sensing accuracy and reduces fronthaul signaling overhead by 99% when compared with the centralized sensing approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eD-VQVAE\u7684\u534f\u4f5cISAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u524d\u4f20\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e99%", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u4e2aAP\u534f\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u57fa\u5730\u611f\u77e5\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u4fe1\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u5230CPU\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u524d\u4f20\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u4f5c\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff1aAP\u672c\u5730\u538b\u7f29\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u540e\u8f6c\u53d1\u7ed9CPU\uff0cCPU\u805a\u5408\u6240\u6709AP\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(D-VQVAE)\uff0c\u5305\u542bAP\u5904\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u7801\u672c\u548cCPU\u5904\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cD-VQVAE\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u524d\u4f20\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8699%", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684D-VQVAE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u4f20\u4fe1\u4ee4\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u91cf"}}

To deal with this issue, in this paper, a novel waveform design is presented for the partial-time superimposed (PTS) ISAC system. At the base station (BS), a parameter-adjustable linear frequency modulation (LFM) pulse signal and a continuous communication orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal are employed to broadcast public information and perform sensing tasks, respectively, using a PTS scheme. Pulse compression gain enhances the system's long-range sensing capability, while OFDM ensures the system's high-speed data transmission capability. Meanwhile, the LFM signal is utilized as superimposed pilot for channel estimation, which has higher time-frequency resource utilization and stronger real-time performance compared to orthogonal pilots. We present an accurate parameter estimation method of multi-path sensing signal for reconstructing and interference cancellation in communication users. Additionally, a cyclic maximum likelihood method is introduced for channel estimation and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of channel estimation is derived. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed parameter estimation algorithm as well as the improved channel estimation performance over traditional methods.

We collected extensive measurement data across the 88 MHz to 6 GHz range in both urban and rural environments. As a case study to validate our methodology, we focus on the FM radio band, which allows us to use publicly available transmitter locations and transmit power levels to facilitate comparisons between analytical with measurement results. We identify a clear transition from non-line-of-sight (NLoS) to line-of-sight (LoS) regimes at a specific altitude threshold and propose an altitude-dependent path loss model that incorporates this transition.

However, the channel estimation overhead is the main hurdle for reaping the above gain in practice. This letter addresses this issue for group-connected BDRIS aided uplink communication from multiple multi-antenna users to one multi-antenna base station (BS). We first reveal that within each BD-RIS group, the cascaded channel associated with one user antenna and one BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other user antenna and BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-BS channel. This insight drastically reduces the dimensionality of the channel estimation problem. Building on this property, we propose an efficient two-phase channel estimation protocol.

We show that the signal orbit and the rotation distribution are jointly identifiable from the first and second moments. This yields an improved high-noise sample complexity that scales quadratically with the noise variance, rather than cubically as in the uniform-rotation case. We further develop a provable, computationally efficient reconstruction algorithm that recovers the 3-D signal by successively solving a sequence of well-conditioned linear systems.

However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points.

To address this issue, we propose a fast GFRFT (FGFRFT) algorithm for unitary GFT matrices based on Fourier series approximation and an efficient caching strategy. FGFRFT reduces the complexity of generating transform matrices to $O(2LN^2)$ while preserving differentiability, thereby enabling adaptive order learning. We validate the algorithm through theoretical analysis, approximation accuracy tests, and order learning experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its practical efficacy for image and point cloud denoising and present the fractional specformer, which integrates the FGFRFT into the specformer architecture. This integration enables the model to overcome the limitations of a fixed GFT basis and learn optimal fractional orders for complex data.

This paper investigates transmitter anonymity at the physical layer from a signal design perspective. We consider an anonymous communication problem where the receiver should reliably decode the signal from the transmitter but should not make use of the signal to infer the transmitter's identity.Transmitter anonymity is quantified using a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)-based metric, which enables the formulation of explicit anonymity constraints in the precoder design.We then propose an anonymous symbol-level precoding strategy that preserves reliable communication under spatial multiplexing while preventing transmitter identification. The proposed framework employs a partitioned equal-gain combining (P-EGC) scheme that leverages receiver diversity without requiring transmitter-specific CSI. Simulation results demonstrate anonymity-reliability tradeoffs across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and numbers of data streams.

In this letter, we investigate localization in PASS by jointly exploiting the received signal amplitude and phase information, unlike recent works that consider only the amplitude information. A complex baseband signal model is formulated to capture free-space path loss, waveguide attenuation, and distance-dependent phase rotation between the user and each pinching antenna. Using this model, we derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to the user location and obtain closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the position error bound (PEB). A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that jointly considers the received signal amplitude and phase is developed to estimate the unknown user location. Given the non-convexity of the estimation problem, a two-stage solution combining coarse grid search and Levenberg-Marquardt refinement is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed phase-aware estimator outperforms existing amplitude-only method in terms of positioning accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u634f\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf(PASS)\u4e2d\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e45\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u634f\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf(PASS)\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u3001\u6ce2\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u76f8\u4f4d\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u590d\u57fa\u5e26\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u63a8\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u77e9\u9635(FIM)\uff0c\u5f97\u5230CRLB\u548cPEB\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136(ML)\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b4. \u9488\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u7c97\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22+Levenberg-Marquardt\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ec5\u5e45\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86PASS\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u634f\u5408\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5ML\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, current literature mostly focuses on discrete time (DT) models, often overlooking effects and hardware non-idealities of actual continuous time (CT) signal generation. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing a CT-analytical framework based on the affine Fourier series (AFS) representation, which allows us to demonstrate that strictly bandlimited pulses and subcarrier suppression strategies are essential to maintain the multicarrier structure of the signal. In addition, we derive the analytical power spectral density of AFDM and evaluate its spectral characteristics in comparison with other multicarrier schemes, considering the impact of realistic truncated pulse-shaping. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the CT model to phase noise, carrier frequency offset, and sampling jitter, providing a theoretical analysis of communication performance. Finally, we derive closed-form Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds for channel parameter estimation, showing that the chirped modulation peculiar of AFDM increases the estimation variance but enables the resolution of Doppler ambiguities.

In this study, we introduce a novel biologically inspired protection system based on neuromorphic principles, where each distributed energy resource (DER) functions as a simple neuron. These neurons process local changes in voltage, current signals, and converting them into spike patterns that represent the severity of disturbances. Just as neurons communicate via synapses in biological systems, we exploit transmission cables to coordinate between DERs, enabling them to share information and respond to faults collectively. Fault detection and circuit breaker activation are driven by a First-To-Spike (FTTS) mechanism, similar to the concept of traveling wave protection, but without needing GPS synchronization or communication links. A key innovation is the ability to use the timing of spikes to locally determine the nature of a fault, offering an intelligent, adaptive response to disturbances. Performance shows tripping latency of 10-58 ms, surpassing conventional relays and even traveling-wave methods (60 ms), while maintaining detection accuracy above 98% and spatial selectivity over 97%, enabling real-time, communication-free, scalable protection for plug-and-play microgrids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u539f\u7406\u7684\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u89c6\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u672c\u5730\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u8f93\u7535\u7f06\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9996\u5c16\u5cf0\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6545\u969c\u7535\u6d41\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u672c\u5730\u7535\u538b\u3001\u7535\u6d41\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u6270\u52a8\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u8f93\u7535\u7f06\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u7a81\u89e6\"\u534f\u8c03DERs\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u9996\u5c16\u5cf0\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65ad\u8def\u5668\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700GPS\u540c\u6b65\u6216\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u3002", "result": "\u8df3\u95f8\u5ef6\u8fdf10-58ms\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u548c\u884c\u6ce2\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0860ms\uff09\uff1b\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc798%\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8d85\u8fc797%\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u65e0\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u3002"}}

In this paradigm, analog signals are converted into event timings by an integrate-and-fire circuit, allowing information to be represented through spike times rather than amplitude samples. While event-driven sampling eliminates the need for a fixed-rate clock, receivers equipped with integrate-and-fire time encoding machines, called time encoding receivers, often assume perfect symbol synchronization, leaving the problem of symbol timing recovery unresolved. This paper presents a joint timing recovery and data detection framework for integrate-and-fire time encoding receivers. The log-likelihood function is derived to capture the dependence between firing times, symbol timing offset, and transmitted sequence, leading to a maximum likelihood formulation for joint timing estimation and sequence detection.

A fundamental challenge lies in optimally selecting the operating modes of access points (APs) to jointly maximize the received energy and satisfy spectral efficiency (SE) quality-of-service constraints. Practical system impairments, including a non-linear harvested energy model, pilot contamination (PC), channel estimation errors, and reliance on long-term statistical channel state information (CSI), are considered. We derive closed-form expressions for both the achievable SE and the average sum harvested energy (sum-HE). A mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the SIM phase shifts, APs mode selection, and power allocation to maximize average sum-HE under SE and average harvested energy constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which efficiently handles high-dimensional decision spaces. A Markovian environment and a normalized joint reward function are introduced to enhance the training stability across on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. Additionally, we provide a two-phase convex-based solution as a theoretical robust performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based CTDE framework achieves SWIPT performance comparable to convexification-based solution, while significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u667a\u80fd\u8d85\u8868\u9762(SIM)\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3001SIM\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3001SIM\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u635f\u4f24\u5982\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5bfc\u9891\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\u3002", "method": "1) \u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u603b\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6563\u6267\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8054\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b5) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DRL-based CTDE\u6846\u67b6\u5728SWIPT\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u635f\u4f24\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u667a\u80fd\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u7684\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u591a\u5740\u63a5\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work studies digital OAC with QAM-based signaling under heavy-tailed interference modeled by a Cauchy distribution (lacking a finite second moment).

Each metasurface supports continuous surface currents that radiate electromagnetic (EM) waves for information and energy transmission to the users. These waves propagate through continuous EM channels characterized by the dyadic Green function. We formulate a system power consumption (PC) minimization problem subject to spectral efficiency and energy harvesting quality of service (QoS) requirements, where the QoS requirements are derived under the equal power allocation (EPA) scheme. An efficient two layer optimization algorithm is developed to solve this problem by optimizing the power allocation subject to the QoS violation penalties using augmented Lagrangian transformation. Our numerical results show that well optimized current distributions over each metasurface in the proposed D CAPA achieve up to 65% and 61% reductions in overall system PC compared to the EPA and colocated CAPA (C CAPA) cases, while maintaining the same total aperture size and transmission power.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217(D CAPA)\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7528\u6237\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u9762\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b49\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u9635\u5217\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u8017\u8fbe65%\u548c61%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u6237\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u9762\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u78c1\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u589e\u5e7f\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u53d8\u6362\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8fdd\u89c4\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684D CAPA\u76f8\u6bd4\u7b49\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5b54\u5f84\u5c3a\u5bf8\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u8017\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e65%\u548c61%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u9762\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To manage complexity, the RIS elements are grouped into blocks of different sizes, where all elements within a block share the same state. CSIs have been captured for multiple a) transmitter positions (and fixed receiver location), b) pilot block sizes, and c) state configurations. Furthermore, we calibrated the parameters of state-of-the-art RIS channel models to fit the measured CSI.

Based on the main principles of absorption, adaptation, and recovery, we formulate a security-aware resilience metric to quantify the system performance during and after a security outage. A multi-user service priority-aware power allocation problem is formulated to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between real-time and desired security efficiency, thereby enabling a trade-off between the target user's secrecy performance and multi-user quality of service (QoS). To solve this non-convex problem, a security-aware iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) is employed. The proposed algorithm determines the optimal power allocation strategy by balancing solution quality against recovery time. At each iteration, it evaluates the overall resilience score and selects the strategy that achieves the highest value.

Its assessment either requires the transmission of dedicated pilots or relies on computing the beamforming matrix through minimum mean squared error (MMSE)-based formulations beforehand, a process that introduces significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SINR estimation framework that leverages multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to extract inter-user interference features directly from either channel state information or user location reports. The proposed dual MHSA (DMHSA) models evaluate the SINR of a scheduled user group without requiring explicit MMSE calculations. The architecture achieves a computational complexity reduction by a factor of three in the CSI-based setting and by two orders of magnitude in the location-based configuration, the latter benefiting from the lower dimensionality of user reports. We show that both DMHSA models maintain high estimation accuracy, with the root mean squared error typically below 1 dB with priority-queuing-based scheduled users. These results enable the integration of DMHSA-based estimators into scheduling procedures, allowing the evaluation of multiple candidate user groups and the selection of those offering the highest average SINR and capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6SINR\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97MMSE\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u975e\u5730\u9762\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u7684SINR\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u7528\u5bfc\u9891\u6216\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97MMSE\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u591a\u5934\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7528\u6237\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0fMMSE\u8ba1\u7b97", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff1aCSI\u8bbe\u7f6e\u964d\u4f4e3\u500d\uff0c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u914d\u7f6e\u964d\u4f4e2\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e1dB", "conclusion": "DMHSA\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8c03\u5ea6\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u7528\u6237\u7ec4\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747SINR\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u7ec4"}}

In this paper, we reveal that the solution space of this problem admits a intrinsic geometric structure: it can be partitioned into a finite number of conical regions, each associated with a distinct full-rank integer matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. Leveraging this decomposition, we transform the NP-hard problem into a search over these regions and propose the Multi-Cone Nested Stochastic Pattern Search (MCN-SPS) algorithm.

Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5MCN-SPS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6574\u6570\u8feb\u96f6\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u6574\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u529f\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u77e9\u9635\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684NP-hard\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6574\u6570\u8feb\u96f6\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u6574\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u529f\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u77e5\u662fNP-hard\u7684\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u53ef\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u4e2a\u9525\u5f62\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u79e9\u6574\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06NP-hard\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9525\u5d4c\u5957\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "MCN-SPS\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O(K^4 log K log2(r0))\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dK\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u6570\u3002\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6574\u6570\u8feb\u96f6\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684NP-hard\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u91cf\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Building on a physically consistent mutual coupling model, the beamforming design is formulated as a functional optimization whose optimality condition leads to a Fredholm integral equation. The incorporation of the coupling model, however, substantially increases computational complexity, necessitating efficient and accurate integral equation solvers. In this letter, we propose two efficient solvers: 1) a coordinate-transformation-based kernel approximation that preserves the operator structure while alleviating discretization demands, and 2) a direct lower-upper (LU)-based solver that stably handles the Nystr\u00f6m-discretized system. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to conventional methods, with the LU-based solver emerging as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale CAPA optimization via offline factorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6838\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5LU\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u7535\u78c1\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8026\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "method": "1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6838\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7b97\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5LU\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5904\u7406Nystr\u00f6m\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0cLU\u57fa\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CAPA\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u5b54\u5f84\u9635\u5217\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fLU\u57fa\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}
