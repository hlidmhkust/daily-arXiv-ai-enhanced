### [1] [A Synthetic-to-Real Dehazing Method based on Domain Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05374)

Conclusion: 通过域统一方法可以有效解决合成到真实去雾任务中的分布偏移问题，提升模型在真实场景中的性能表现。

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

### [2] [Stabilizing RED using the Koopman Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05736)
*Shraddha Chavan,Kunal N. Chaudhury*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出基于Koopman算子的数据驱动机制来稳定RED框架，通过低维特征空间捕捉局部动态，利用谱半径检测不稳定性并制定自适应步长规则


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RED框架能产生高保真重建，但使用黑盒去噪器有时会导致不稳定性，需要一种稳定机制

Method: 使用Koopman算子捕捉RED在低维特征空间中的局部动态，通过谱半径检测不稳定性并制定模型无关的自适应步长规则

Result: 测试了多个预训练去噪器，证明了所提出的Koopman稳定方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法具有适度开销且无需重新训练，能够有效稳定RED框架的重建过程

Abstract: The widely used RED (Regularization-by-Denoising) framework uses pretrained
denoisers as implicit regularizers for model-based reconstruction. Although RED
generally yields high-fidelity reconstructions, the use of black-box denoisers
can sometimes lead to instability. In this letter, we propose a data-driven
mechanism to stabilize RED using the Koopman operator, a classical tool for
analyzing dynamical systems. Specifically, we use the operator to capture the
local dynamics of RED in a low-dimensional feature space, and its spectral
radius is used to detect instability and formulate an adaptive step-size rule
that is model-agnostic, has modest overhead, and requires no retraining. We
test this with several pretrained denoisers to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed Koopman stabilization.

### [3] [CardiacFlow: 3D+t Four-Chamber Cardiac Shape Completion and Generation via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05754)
*Qiang Ma,Qingjie Meng,Mengyun Qiao,Paul M. Matthews,Declan P. O'Regan,Wenjia Bai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出基于流匹配技术的3D+t心脏形状生成方法CardiacFlow，通过潜在整流流进行数据增强，从稀疏多视角CMR分割重建完整形状，在WHS和UK Biobank数据集上验证了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从多视角心脏磁共振图像学习3D+t形状补全和生成需要大量高分辨率3D全心脏分割数据来捕捉形状先验，但获取这样的数据成本高昂且困难。

Method: 1) 引入潜在整流流从有限3D WHS数据生成3D心脏形状进行数据增强；2) 在真实和合成数据上训练标签补全网络，从稀疏多视角CMR分割重建3D+t形状；3) 提出CardiacFlow一步生成流模型，基于时间帧的高斯核编码进行条件生成。

Result: 在WHS数据集上，基于流的数据增强使3D形状补全的几何误差降低16%；在UK Biobank数据集上，CardiacFlow相比现有基线方法实现了更优的生成质量和周期性一致性。

Conclusion: 流匹配技术能有效解决心脏形状生成中的数据稀缺问题，CardiacFlow模型在3D+t四腔心脏形状生成方面表现出色，为心脏形态分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Learning 3D+t shape completion and generation from multi-view cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) images requires a large amount of high-resolution 3D
whole-heart segmentations (WHS) to capture shape priors. In this work, we
leverage flow matching techniques to learn deep generative flows for
augmentation, completion, and generation of 3D+t shapes of four cardiac
chambers represented implicitly by segmentations. Firstly, we introduce a
latent rectified flow to generate 3D cardiac shapes for data augmentation,
learnt from a limited number of 3D WHS data. Then, a label completion network
is trained on both real and synthetic data to reconstruct 3D+t shapes from
sparse multi-view CMR segmentations. Lastly, we propose CardiacFlow, a novel
one-step generative flow model for efficient 3D+t four-chamber cardiac shape
generation, conditioned on the periodic Gaussian kernel encoding of time
frames. The experiments on the WHS datasets demonstrate that flow-based data
augmentation reduces geometric errors by 16% in 3D shape completion. The
evaluation on the UK Biobank dataset validates that CardiacFlow achieves
superior generation quality and periodic consistency compared to existing
baselines.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor
diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high
accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and
accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major
source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we
classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using
Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We
also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer
learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model
performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The
Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5%
Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN,
UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective
treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices
such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect
real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for
timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset
validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned
EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96%
specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore
the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets,
reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient
care in IoT healthcare environments.

### [5] [Application Space and the Rate-Distortion-Complexity Analysis of Neural Video CODECs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05929)
*Ricardo L. de Queiroz,Diogo C. Garcia,Yi-Hsin Chen,Ruhan Conceição,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Luciano V. Agostini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通过引入三维率-失真-复杂度(RDC)空间分析，提出了基于拉格朗日代价D+λR+γC的视频压缩系统选择方法，并在多个神经网络视频编码器上进行对比分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二维率-失真(BD)指标无法充分考虑视频压缩系统的复杂度成本，需要拓展到三维RDC空间来更全面地评估编码器性能

Method: 形成三维RDC空间的概念扩展，使用拉格朗日代价D+λR+γC来定义编码器成本，将应用程序与(λ, γ)点相关联，并在多个先进神经网络视频编码器上进行对比实验

Result: 在RDC计算约束下，只有四个神经网络视频编码器在某些(λ, γ)点上表现最优，结果具有信息量且出乎意料

Conclusion: 提出的RDC分析框架能够在不同应用场景下系统性地比较不同视频压缩系统，为视频编码器选择提供了重要的理论基础和实践指南

Abstract: We study the decision-making process for choosing video compression systems
through a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) analysis. We discuss the 2D
Bjontegaard delta (BD) metric and formulate generalizations in an attempt to
extend its notions to the 3D RDC volume. We follow that discussion with another
one on the computation of metrics in the RDC volume, and on how to define and
measure the cost of a coder-decoder (codec) pair, where the codec is
characterized by a cloud of points in the RDC space. We use a Lagrangian cost
$D+\lambda R + \gamma C$, such that choosing the best video codec among a
number of candidates for an application demands selecting appropriate
$(\lambda, \gamma)$ values. Thus, we argue that an application may be
associated with a $(\lambda, \gamma)$ point in the application space. An
example streaming application was given as a case study to set a particular
point in the $(\lambda, \gamma)$ plane. The result is that we can compare
Lagrangian costs in an RDC volume for different codecs for a given application.
Furthermore, we can span the plane and compare codecs for the entire
application space filled with different $(\lambda, \gamma)$ choices. We then
compared several state-of-the-art neural video codecs using the proposed
metrics. Results are informative and surprising. We found that, within our RDC
computation constraints, only four neural video codecs came out as the best
suited for any application, depending on where its desirable $(\lambda,
\gamma)$ lies.

### [6] [Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978)
*Mohamed Mohamed,Brennan Nichyporuk,Douglas L. Arnold,Tal Arbel*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于语言提示生成高分辨率3D医学对冲图像的框架，采用改进的3D滿散模型来模拟多发硬化和阿尔茨海默病等神经系统疾病的病理变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉-语言模型在2D图像生成方面表现突出，但在3D医学图像领域缺乏领先基础模型，导致语言指导的高分辨率3D医学对冲图像生成方法很少被探索。这个空白限制了个性化对冲解释、疾病进展模拟和医学培训等临床应用的发展。

Method: 研究者修改了最先进的3D滿散模型，融入了Simple Diffusion的改进技术，并采用增强条件控制来提升文本对齐和图像质量。这是首个专门应用于神经系统形态学数据的语言指导原生3D滿散模型。

Result: 在两个不同的神经系统MRI数据集上，该框架成功模拟了多发硬化的不同病变负荷以及阿尔茨海默病的认知状态。模型能够生成高质量图像，同时保持了生成医学图像中的主体信度。

Conclusion: 这项研究为基于提示驱动的3D医学图像疾病进展分析奠定了基础，开启了语言指导高分辨率3D医学对冲图像生成的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive
performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

### [7] [FASL-Seg: Anatomy and Tool Segmentation of Surgical Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06159)
*Muraam Abdel-Ghani,Mahmoud Ali,Mohamed Ali,Fatmaelzahraa Ahmed,Mohamed Arsalan,Abdulaziz Al-Ali,Shidin Balakrishnan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出FASL-Seg模型，通过双流处理机制（LLFP和HLFP）同时捕获高低层次特征，在手术场景语义分割任务中显著提升性能，在EndoVis数据集上mIoU达到72.71%-85.61%，超越现有最佳方法5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术语义分割研究主要关注手术工具而忽略解剖结构，且当前SOTA模型难以平衡高层次上下文特征和低层次边缘特征的捕获。

Method: 提出特征自适应空间定位模型（FASL-Seg），包含低层次特征投影（LLFP）和高层次特征投影（HLFP）两个处理流，分别处理不同分辨率的特征，实现解剖结构和手术器械的精确分割。

Result: 在EndoVis18数据集上，解剖结构分割mIoU达到72.71%，比SOTA提升5%；在EndoVis18和EndoVis17工具类型分割任务中分别达到85.61%和72.78%的mIoU，整体性能优于SOTA，各类别性能一致稳定。

Conclusion: FASL-Seg通过双流特征处理机制有效解决了多层次特征捕获问题，在手术场景语义分割中表现出色，证明了针对不同分辨率特征采用差异化处理流的有效性。

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

*Fangyijie Wang,Guénolé Silvestre,Kathleen M. Curran*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于信息散度的半监督学习框架，通过结合轻量卷积网络和Transformer网络，利用标签和无标签数据进行胎儿超声分割，解决医学图像注释稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 母产-胎儿超声是监测胎儿发育的主要方式，但自动分割面临高质量注释稀缺的挑战。

Method: 使用轻量卷积网络(1.47M参数)和Transformer网络，通过标准监督和交叉监督进行联合训练。引入信息散度损失（Kullback-Leibler散度+互信息差距）来减少模型预测分歧，并在无标签样本上应用mixup提升稳健性。

Result: 在两个胎儿超声数据集上超越4种最先进半监督方法。仅5%标签数据下，Dice得分提升2.39%，95% Hausdorff距离降低14.90，平均表面距离降低4.18。

Conclusion: 证明了利用信息散度可以实现高效注释和稳健的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Maternal-fetal Ultrasound is the primary modality for monitoring fetal
development, yet automated segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity
of high-quality annotations. To address this limitation, we propose a
semi-supervised learning framework that leverages information divergence for
robust fetal ultrasound segmentation. Our method employs a lightweight
convolutional network (1.47M parameters) and a Transformer-based network,
trained jointly with labelled data through standard supervision and with
unlabelled data via cross-supervision. To encourage consistent and confident
predictions, we introduce an information divergence loss that combines
per-pixel Kullback-Leibler divergence and Mutual Information Gap, effectively
reducing prediction disagreement between the two models. In addition, we apply
mixup on unlabelled samples to further enhance robustness. Experiments on two
fetal ultrasound datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods. When only 5% of
training data is labelled, our framework improves the Dice score by 2.39%,
reduces the 95% Hausdorff distance by 14.90, and decreases the Average Surface
Distance by 4.18. These results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging
information divergence for annotation-efficient and robust medical image
segmentation. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints,
heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL
achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at
0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777).
Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD:
1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL
scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD:
1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring
reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and
outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client
loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support
FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI
deployment.

Abstract: In subjective assessment of image and video quality, observers rate or
compare selected stimuli. Before calculating the mean opinion scores (MOS) for
these stimuli from the ratings, it is recommended to identify and deal with
outliers that may have given unreliable ratings. Several methods are available
for this purpose, some of which have been standardized. These methods are
typically based on statistics and sometimes tested by introducing synthetic
ratings from artificial outliers, such as random clickers. However, a reliable
and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of
outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an
empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution. Our method involves
evolutionary optimization of an adversarial black-box attack on outlier
detection algorithms, where the adversary maximizes the distortion of scale
values with respect to ground truth. We apply our analysis to several hard and
soft outlier detection methods for absolute category ratings and show their
differing performance in this stress test. In addition, we propose two new
outlier detection methods with low complexity and excellent worst-case
performance. Software for adversarial attacks and data analysis is available.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效协调不同扫描仪的脑部MRI图像，显著提升多中心和纵向临床研究的可比性、可重复性和泛化能力

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and
research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters
cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and
reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner
harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations,
such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen
domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder
with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize
MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method
enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms
baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects
dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides
robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without
requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability,
reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical
studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MM-DINOv2是一个基于DINOv2视觉基础模型的多模态医学影像分析框架，通过多模态补丁嵌入、全模态掩码和半监督学习，有效解决了医学影像中的多模态处理和缺失模态问题。

Conclusion: 该工作为多模态医学影像任务提供了可扩展的鲁棒解决方案，能够有效利用自然图像预训练的视觉基础模型，同时解决临床中的缺失数据和有限标注等现实挑战

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both

### [13] [Developing a Framework to Simulate Quantitative Ultrasound Flow and Tissue Motion for Ultrafast Doppler Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05464)
*Qiang Fu,Changhui Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了首个开源3D定量血流模拟框架3D-FQFlow，用于在真实血管和运动条件下验证超快速功率多普勒成像(uPDI)，支持三维血管流动定量建模和组织运动模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够在接近真实条件下进行三维定量血流和组织运动模拟的工具，限制了uPDI技术的研究和临床应用验证。

Method: 集成L系统血管生成器、SimVascular CFD血流动力学模拟、组织运动模拟器、优化的PFILED超声模拟器、预计算矩阵重建器和定量分析器(MSE/PSNR/SSIM)。

Result: 成功实现了兔肾脏(SSIM=0.951)、生成血管(SSIM=0.902)和临床肺动脉(SSIM=0.850)的3D成像；GPU加速实现100帧3D-uPDI生成18.8倍速度提升，100万散射体模拟仅需4,117秒。

Conclusion: 3D-FQFlow建立了首个在真实血管和运动条件下定量验证uPDI的开源框架，为微血管成像研究创建了可重复的标准。

Abstract: Ultrafast power Doppler imaging (uPDI) has made significant progress and
become an important imaging method for both research and clinical
implementations. While, it lacks simulation tools that can perform
three-dimensional (3D) quantitative flow with tissue motion close to realistic
conditions. In this study, we explore to construct an open-source framework,
named 3D-Fully Quantitative Flow (3D-FQFlow), to provide quantitative modeling
of 3D vascular flow with tissue motion and uPDI imaging. The framework
integrates a L-system-based vascular generator with SimVascular CFD for
hemodynamics, a tissue motion simulator supporting user-defined or
clinical-data-driven condition, an optimized PFILED ultrasound simulator, a
precomputed-matrix-based reconstructor, and a quantitative analyzer
(MSE/PSNR/SSIM). Results demonstrate distinct influences of four motion
patterns on SVD decomposition; successful 3D imaging of rabbit kidney (SSIM =
0.951), generated vasculature (SSIM = 0.902), and clinical pulmonary arteries
(SSIM = 0.850); and GPU acceleration permitting 1-million-scatterer simulation
in 4,117 seconds with 18.8* speedup for 100-frame 3D-uPDI generation. 3D-FQFlow
establishes the first open-source framework for quantitative validation of uPDI
under realistic vascular and motion conditions, creating a reproducible
standard for microvascular imaging research

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 通过时间调制智能反射表面(TM-IRS)和生成流网络(GFlowNet)框架，实现集成感知与通信系统的物理层安全，在保证合法用户通信性能的同时屏蔽偷听者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成感知与通信(ISAC)系统中存在目标可能作为偷听者的安全风险，需要一种能够同时优化通信性能、感知性能和安全性的方案。

Method: 使用时间调制智能反射表面(TM-IRS)，通过生成流网络(GFlowNet)框架学习随机策略，从庞大的离散参数空间中采样高性能TM-IRS配置。构建基于合法用户可实现总速率和目标方向收益图增益的奖励函数。

Result: 实验结果证明方法能够同时集成感知、通信和安全功能，与经验组合搜索相比显著提高采样效率，并对基于规则的TM-IRS设计方法具有更强的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的GFlowNet基于TM-IRS的方法为ISAC系统提供了一种高效的物理层安全解决方案，能够在复杂环境下同时优化多个性能指标。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to achieve physical layer security for integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in the presence of targets
that may be eavesdroppers. The system is aided by a time-modulated intelligent
reflecting surface (TM-IRS), which is configured to preserve the integrity of
the transmitted data at one or more legitimate communication users (CUs) while
making them appear scrambled in all other directions. The TM-IRS design
leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) framework to learn a stochastic
policy that samples high-performing TM-IRS configurations from a vast discrete
parameter space. Specifically, we begin by formulating the achievable sum rate
for the legitimate CUs and the beampattern gain toward the target direction,
based on which we construct reward functions for GFlowNets that jointly capture
both communication and sensing performance. The TM-IRS design is modeled as a
deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state
corresponds to a complete configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets,
parametrized by deep neural networks are employed to learn a stochastic policy
that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their
associated reward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed GFlowNet-based method in integrating sensing, communication and
security simultaneously, and also exhibit significant sampling efficiency as
compared to the exhaustive combinatorial search and enhanced robustness against
the rule-based TM-IRS design method.

TL;DR: 提出基于单层神经网络的BD-RIS信道估计方法，仅使用接收功率测量值，无需专用导频信号，降低系统开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BD-RIS信道估计方法依赖专用导频信号，增加系统开销且与现有通信协议不兼容，需要更高效的估计方案

Method: 利用接收信号功率可表示为单层神经网络的形式，通过反向传播算法基于不同训练反射系数下的功率测量值恢复信道状态信息

Result: 数值结果表明该方法可实现较小的归一化均方误差，特别是在训练反射次数较多时性能更优

Conclusion: 所提出的神经网络方法为BD-RIS提供了一种低开销、兼容性好的信道估计解决方案

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its
enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated
notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a
key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel
state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing
BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which
increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication
protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new
single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing
only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In
particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form
similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI.
This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation,
based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection
coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a
small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of
training reflections is large.

Result: 分析和数值结果显示，该系统在空间分辨率、通信速率等关键性能指标上超过传统ULA/UCA基于所片区系统

Conclusion: 全角RAA基于全向通信系统能够显著降低用户间干扰、提高成本效益，为未来无线通信提供更优的解决方案

Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) was recently proposed as a novel multi-antenna
architecture that arranges multiple massive cheap antenna elements into simple
uniform linear arrays (sULAs) with different orientations. Compared with
traditional architectures like hybrid analog/digital beamforming with uniform
linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA), RAA has several promising
advantages such as significantly reduced hardware cost, higher beamforming
gains and the ability of providing uniform angular resolution for all
directions. In this paper, we propose a full-angle RAA architecture and an
innovative omnicell wireless communication paradigm enabled by full-angle RAA.
The proposed full-angle RAA expands RAA's orientation angle to the full angle
domain, such that the RAA's advantages can be exploited to all directions. This
further enables the new concept of omnicell wireless communication system, with
the base station equipped by full-angle RAA and deployed at the center of each
cell. Compared to the conventional cell sectoring wireless communication
system, the proposed omnicell system is expected to not only significantly
reduce the inter-user interference, but also improve the cost efficiency.
Extensive analytical and numerical results are provided to compare those key
performance indicators such as the spatial resolution and the communication
rate of the proposed full-angle RAA based omnicell wireless communication
system against the conventional ULA/UCA-based cell sectoring systems.

TL;DR: AFBM波形通过结合滤波器组多载波调制和啁啾域波形技术，在6G集成感知与通信中实现了低PAPR、低带外发射，并通过GaBP算法和EM-PDA框架分别实现可靠通信和目标感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对6G集成感知与通信需求，传统AFDM波形在双弥散信道下存在高峰均比和带外发射问题，需要开发性能更优的新型波形。

Method: 结合经典滤波器组多载波调制理论和啁啾域波形技术，设计AFBM波形；通信方面采用高斯置信传播算法进行符号检测，感知方面采用期望最大化辅助的概率数据关联框架进行目标估计。

Result: AFBM相比传统AFDM具有显著更低的峰均比和带外发射，通过模糊函数、误码率和均方根误差等指标验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: AFBM波形在集成感知与通信方面展现出优异性能，是下一代无线系统的有前景的波形方案。

Abstract: We propose the affine filter bank modulation (AFBM) waveform for enhanced
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in sixth generation (6G), designed
by drawing on concepts from classical filter bank multicarrier modulation
(FBMC) theory and recent advances in chirp-domain waveforms, particularly
affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Specifically, AFBM exhibits
several desirable properties, with emphasis on its remarkably low
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and reduced out-of-band emission (OOBE) when
benchmarked against the conventional AFDM waveform under doubly-dispersive (DD)
channel conditions. In the communications setting, reliable symbol detection is
achieved using a tailored low-complexity Gaussian belief propagation
(GaBP)-based algorithm, while in the sensing setting, a range and velocity
estimation approach is developed that integrates an expectation maximization
(EM)-assisted probabilistic data association (PDA) framework to accurately
identify surrounding targets. The highlighted performance and benefits of AFBM
are validated through analytical and numerical evaluations, including
conventional metrics such as ambiguity function (AF), bit error rate (BER), and
root mean square error (RMSE), consolidating its position as a promising
waveform for next-generation wireless systems.

Result: 仿真结果显示Meta-SAC算法优于Meta-DDPG算法，FIM辅助设计方案相比基准方案获得了显著的能效提升

Conclusion: FIM与STAR-BD-RIS和NOMA的集成架构结合Meta-SAC优化算法，能够有效提升无线通信系统的能量效率

Abstract: This study explores a flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM)-based wireless
communication system that integrates simultaneously transmitting and reflecting
beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-BD-RIS) with
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The system features a multi-antenna
FIM-assisted base station (BS) aided by dual-sector BD-RIS. The FIM consists of
cost-effective radiating elements that can independently emit signals and
dynamically adjust their vertical positions ("morphing"). The goal is to
maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing BS beamforming, the
STAR-BD-RIS matrix, NOMA constraints, and the FIM surface shape under power
limits. Due to the problem's non-convexity, a meta-soft actor-critic (Meta-SAC)
algorithm is proposed for adaptive optimization. Simulation results show that
Meta-SAC outperforms the Meta-DDPG algorithm, and FIM-assisted designs yield
substantial energy efficiency gains over benchmark schemes.

Motivation: 海底声学锚点是AUV导航的重要组成部分，但由于水下用户分布不均、设备经济成本高和维护困难，锚点部署通常稀疏，且缺乏卫星覆盖，无法像陆地节点那样形成普遍回传。

Method: 首先分析大规模水下导航系统的可能部署模式，制定水下锚点部署的拓扑优化方案，然后推导给定区域内各集群锚点对导航性能影响的缩放规律，并展示高概率到达目的地的服务区域覆盖条件。

Abstract: Seafloor acoustic anchors are an important component of AUV navigation,
providing absolute updates that correct inertial dead-reckoning. Unlike
terrestrial positioning systems, the deployment of underwater anchor nodes is
usually sparse due to the uneven distribution of underwater users, as well as
the high economic cost and difficult maintenance of underwater equipment. These
anchor nodes lack satellite coverage and cannot form ubiquitous backhaul as
terrestrial nodes do. In this paper, we investigate the optimal anchor
deployment topology to provide high-quality AUV navigation and positioning
services. We first analyze the possible deployment mode in large-scale
underwater navigation system, and formulate a topology optimization for
underwater anchor node deployment. Then, we derive a scaling law about the
influence of anchors in each cluster on the navigation performance within a
given area and demonstrate a service area coverage condition with a high
probability of reaching the destination. Finally, the optimization performance
is evaluated through experimental results.

TL;DR: 本文研究了超低场磁共振成像系统中通道特异性电磁干扰问题，提出了结合前端空间域逆场重建和后端通道自适应主动噪声消除的双级抑制策略，有效提升了系统抗干扰能力和图像质量。

Motivation: 超低场磁共振成像系统在开放环境中极易受到复合电磁干扰，不同成像通道由于耦合特性不同对干扰的响应存在非均匀性，需要研究针对性的干扰抑制方法。

Method: 提出双级抑制策略：前端采用空间域逆场重建，后端采用通道自适应主动噪声消除技术，针对不同线圈类型（鞍形线圈和螺线管线圈）的干扰特性进行差异化处理。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了电磁干扰耦合的通道依赖性，建立了针对性抑制策略，为未来阵列线圈超低场磁共振成像系统的噪声抑制提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging(ULF-MRI) systems operating in open
environments are highly susceptible to composite electromagnetic
interference(EMI). Different imaging channels respond non-uniformly to EMI
owing to their distinct coupling characteristics. Here, we investigate
channel-specific interference pathways in a permanent-magnet-based low-field
MRI system and show that saddle coils are intrinsically more vulnerable to
transverse EMI components than solenoidal coils. To mitigate these
heterogeneous coupling effects, we propose a dual-stage suppression strategy
that combines front-end spatial-domain inverse field reconstruction with
back-end channel-adaptive active noise cancellation. Experiments demonstrate
that this approach suppresses EMI by more than 80%, substantially improves
inter-channel signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) consistency, and enhances the
fused-image SNR by 24%. These findings elucidate the channel-dependent nature
of EMI coupling and establish targeted mitigation strategies, providing both a
theoretical basis and practical guidance for noise suppression in future
array-coil ULF-MRI systems.

Conclusion: DeepStream成功验证了DeepJSCC在现实世界中的可行性，通过创新的映射方法、预编码技术和渐进编码策略，为6G多媒体传输提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a
promising technique in 6G for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of data
transmission across diverse modalities, particularly in low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) environments. This advantage is realized by leveraging powerful
neural networks to learn an optimal end-to-end mapping from the source data
directly to the transmit symbol sequence, eliminating the need for separate
source coding, channel coding, and modulation. Although numerous efforts have
been made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical
simulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of
DeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient
and robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission. In conforming to OFDM, we
develop both a feature-to-symbol mapping method and a cross-subcarrier
precoding method to improve the subcarrier independence and reduce
peak-to-average power ratio. To reduce system complexity and enable flexibility
in accommodating varying quality of service requirements, we further propose a
progressive coding strategy that adjusts the compression ratio based on latency
with minimal performance loss. We implement DeepStream for real-time image
transmission and video streaming using software-defined radio. Extensive
evaluations verify that DeepStream outperforms both the standard scheme and the
direct deployment scheme. Particularly, at an SNR of 10 dB, DeepStream achieves
a PSNR of 35 dB for image transmission and an MS-SSIM of 20 dB for video
streaming, whereas the standard scheme fails to recover meaningful information.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for
spectrum-efficient and hardware-converged wireless networks. However, classical
radar systems within ISAC architectures face fundamental limitations under low
signal power and high-noise conditions. This paper proposes a novel framework
that embeds quantum illumination radar into a base station to simultaneously
support full-duplex classical communication and quantum-enhanced target
detection. The resulting integrated quantum sensing and classical communication
(IQSCC) system is optimized via a sum-rate maximization formulation subject to
radar sensing constraints. The non-convex joint optimization of transmit power
and beamforming vectors is tackled using the successive convex approximation
technique. Furthermore, we derive performance bounds for classical and quantum
radar protocols under the statistical detection theory, highlighting the
quantum advantage in low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio regimes.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IQSCC system achieves a higher
communication throughput than the conventional ISAC baseline while satisfying
the sensing requirement.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种通过动态天线重配和感知跟踪来提升隐藏通信性能的有效方案，为安全通信系统设计开拓了新的设计自由度。

Abstract: A sensing-aided covert communication network empowered by pinching antenna
systems (PASS) is proposed in this work. Unlike conventional fixed-position
MIMO arrays, PASS dynamically reconfigures its pinching antennas (PAs) closer
to the legitimate user, substantially enhancing covertness. To further secure
the adversary's channel state information (CSI), a sensing function is
leveraged to track the malicious warden's movements. In particular, this paper
first proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based approach to fulfilling the
tracking function. Building on this, a covert communication problem is
formulated with a joint design of beamforming, artificial noise (AN) signals,
and the position of PAs. Then, the beamforming and AN design subproblems are
resolved jointly with a subspace approach, while the PA position optimization
subproblem is handled by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach by
treating the evolution of the warden's mobility status as a temporally
corrected process. Numerical results are presented and demonstrate that: i) the
EKF approach can accurately track the warden's CSI with low complexity, ii) the
effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by its outperformance over
the greedy and searching-based benchmarks, and iii) with new design degrees of
freedom (DoFs), the performance of PASS is superior to the conventional
fully-digital MIMO systems.

Conclusion: MelodyBedScale提供了一种快速、准确、非侵入式的卧床患者体重估算解决方案，在急诊医疗中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: Rapid and accurate body weight estimation is critical in emergency medical
care, as it directly influences treatment decisions, such as drug dosing,
defibrillation energy selection, and fluid resuscitation. Traditional methods
such as stand-on scales, length-based tapes, or transfer-based weighing scales
are often impractical for immobilized patients, inaccurate, or labor-intensive
and time-consuming. This paper introduces MelodyBedScale, a non-intrusive and
rapid on-bed weight estimation system that leverages bed vibration induced by
music. The core insight is that body weight affects the vibration transfer
function of the bed-body system, which is captured using vibration sensors
placed on opposite sides of the bed. First, we identify weight-sensitive
frequency bands and compose clinically acceptable soft, natural music with high
signal energy in these frequency bands. This music is then played through a
speaker mounted on the bed to induce bed vibrations. Additionally, to
efficiently capture the complex weight-vibration relationship with limited data

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑功率放大器非线性失真的最优功率分配策略，在大规模MIMO-OFDM系统中显著提升了和速率性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实无线发射机前端存在非线性行为（如功率放大器削波），现有资源分配方案忽略这种非线性会导致结果不准确和性能损失

Method: 采用软限幅器PA模型，推导宽带信噪失真比(SNDR)，将非凸优化问题分解为总功率分配和用户间功率分布两个子问题，提出交替优化算法

Result: 仿真结果显示相比忽略失真的方案，64天线基站服务60用户时中位数提升4倍，512天线时中位数提升50%

Conclusion: 功率放大器引入的失真会导致SNDR有效工作点，无需显式发射功率约束，所提算法能有效找到最优解

Abstract: Real-world wireless transmitter front-ends exhibit certain nonlinear
behavior, e.g., signal clipping by a Power Amplifier (PA). Although many
resource allocation solutions do not consider this for simplicity, it leads to
inaccurate results or a reduced number of degrees of freedom, not achieving the
global performance. In this work, we propose an optimal PA distortion-aware
power allocation strategy in a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplex
(OFDM) based massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) system. Assuming a
soft-limiter PA model, where the transmission occurs under small-scale
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading channel, we
derive the wideband signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and formulate
the power allocation problem. Most interestingly, the distortion introduced by
the PA leads to an SNDR-efficient operating point without explicit transmit
power constraints. While the optimization problem is non-convex, we decouple it
into a non-convex total power allocation problem and a convex power
distribution problem among the users (UEs). We propose an alternating
optimization algorithm to find the optimum solution. Our simulation results
show significant sum-rate gains over existing distortion-neglecting solutions,
e.g., a median 4 times increase and a median 50\% increase for a 64-antenna and
512-antenna base station serving 60 users, respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables more accurate and comprehensive scene
understanding by learning how to share information between agents, with LiDAR
point clouds providing essential precise spatial data. Due to the substantial
data volume generated by LiDAR sensors, efficient point cloud transmission is
essential for low-latency multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose
an efficient, robust and applicable LiDAR point cloud transmission system via
the Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), termed LiDAR Point Cloud Feature
Transmission (LPC-FT), to support collaborative perception among multiple
agents. Specifically, we employ a density-preserving deep point cloud
compression method that encodes the complete point cloud into a downsampled
efficient representation. To mitigate the effects of the wireless channel, we
design a channel encoder module based on self-attention to enhance LiDAR point
cloud features and a feature fusion module based on cross-attention to
integrate features from transceivers. Furthermore, we utilize the nonlinear
activation layer and transfer learning to improve the training of deep neural
networks in the presence the digital channel noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed LPC-FT is more robust and effective than
traditional octree-based compression followed by channel coding, and
outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based compression techniques and
existing semantic communication methods, reducing the Chamfer Distance by 30%
and improving the PSNR by 1.9 dB on average. Owing to its superior
reconstruction performance and robustness against channel variations, LPC-FT is
expected to support collaborative perception tasks.

Motivation: 当前联合检测跟踪方法在充分利用雷达信号潜力方面存在挑战，包括CFAR模型信息表示能力有限、复杂场景描述不足以及跟踪器获取信息有限

Method: InDT方法包含雷达信号检测网络架构和检测辅助的跟踪器。检测器从RD矩阵提取特征，通过特征增强模块和检测头返回目标位置。跟踪器基于检测置信度自适应更新卡尔曼滤波器的测量噪声协方差，使用余弦距离测量目标RD特征相似度

Result: 在模拟数据和公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的InDT方法通过结合位置和特征信息增强了数据关联过程，有效解决了当前联合检测跟踪方法的局限性

Abstract: Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint
detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection
thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing
the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited
capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent
information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited
information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and
Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network
architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection
assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each
Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the
feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively
updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on
detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by
cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining
location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method
was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available
datasets.

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable

classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards
increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as

Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced
reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a
small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability
to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using
adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for
single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and
limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing
acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and
their accurate and robust detection and classification.

<details>

Motivation: 大规模MIMO系统虽然能显著提升频谱效率，但高功耗限制了其广泛应用。近阈值计算(NTC)能降低能耗但易受PVT变化影响导致计算错误，传统电路级错误检测方法硬件复杂度高

Method: 修改矩阵算术牛顿迭代MIMO算法，无缝集成ABFT技术来检测计算错误。ABFT作为轻量级错误检测方法，专为矩阵操作设计，无需电路级修改，可纯软件实现

Conclusion: ABFT与近阈值操作相结合，为能效高且鲁棒的大规模MIMO处理器提供了可行路径

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems have the potential to significantly enhance spectral
efficiency, yet their widespread integration is hindered by the high power
consumption of the underlying computations. This paper explores the
applicability and effectiveness of Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) for
massive MIMO signal processing to tackle the reliability challenge of Near
Threshold Computing (NTC). We propose modifying matrix arithmetic Newton
iteration MIMO algorithm to seamlessly integrate ABFT to detect any
computational errors by inspecting the final result. The overhead from ABFT
depends largely on the matrix dimensions, which in this context are dictated by
the number of user equipments involved in the computation. NTC is a promising
strategy for reducing the energy consumption in digital circuits by operating
transistors at extremely reduced voltages. However, NTC is highly susceptible
to variations in Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) which can lead to
increased error rates in computations. Traditional techniques for enabling NTC,
such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling guided by circuit level timing
error detection methods, introduce considerable hardware complexity and are
difficult to implement at high clock frequencies. In this context ABFT has
emerged as a lightweight error detection method tailored for matrix operations
without requiring any modifications on circuit-level and can be implemented
purely in software.A MIMO accelerator was implemented on a reconfigurable
hardware platform. Experimental results demonstrate that for sufficiently large
problem sizes, the proposed method achieves a 36% power saving compared to
baseline, with only an average of 3% computational overhead, at default clock
frequency. These results indicate that combining ABFT with near-threshold
operation provides a viable path toward energy-efficient and robust massive
MIMO processors.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of resource efficiency maximization in an
active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS) assisted communication system under practical transceiver
hardware impairments (HWIs). We aim to obtain an optimal tradeoff between
system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), by jointly
optimizing the base station (BS) transmit beamforming and the active STAR-RIS
beamforming. To tackle the challenges in the fractional objective function, we
begin by applying the quadratic transformation method to simplify it into a
manageable form. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then developed
to iteratively update the BS and STAR-RIS beamforming coefficients. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than other
baseline schemes in the presence of HWIs. Moreover, the variation of the
achievable SE-EE region with different transmit power budgets is analyzed.

Conclusion: 该研究首次在6.75GHz频段通过无线光线追踪实现了多跳ISAC成像，为6G集成感知与通信技术提供了重要的技术支撑。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is emerging as a cornerstone
technology for sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, unifying connectivity
and environmental mapping through shared hardware, spectrum, and waveforms. The
following paper presents an ISAC imaging framework utilizing channel state
information (CSI) per-path components, transmitter (TX) positions, and receiver
(RX) positions obtained from the calibrated NYURay ray tracer at 6.75 GHz in
the upper mid-band. Our work shows how each resolvable multipath component can
be extracted from CSI estimation and cast into an equivalent three-dimensional
reflection point by fusing its angle and delay information, which is useful and
challenging for multi-bounce reflections. The primary contribution of the paper
is the two-segment reflection point optimization algorithm, which independently
estimates the path lengths from the TX position and RX position to an
equivalent reflection point (ERP) on the object surface, thus enabling precise
geometric reconstruction. Subsequently, we aggregate the ERPs derived from
multiple pairs of TX and RX positions, generating dense three dimensional point
clouds representing the objects in the channel. Experimental results validate
that the proposed ISAC imaging framework accurately reconstructs object
surfaces, edges, and curved features. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
provides the first demonstration of multi bounce ISAC imaging using wireless
ray tracing at 6.75 GHz.

Conclusion: 该模拟器为雷达HAR算法设计和验证提供了价值工具，已在GitHub开源发布

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a pivotal research area for
applications requiring non-invasive monitoring. However, the acquisition of
diverse and high-fidelity radar datasets for robust algorithm development
remains a significant challenge. To overcome this bottleneck, a model-based
frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar HAR simulator is developed.
The simulator integrates an anthropometrically scaled $13$-scatterer kinematic
model to simulate $12$ distinct activities. The FMCW radar echo model is
employed, which incorporates dynamic radar cross-section (RCS), free-space or
through-the-wall propagation, and a calibrated noise floor to ensure signal
fidelity. The simulated raw data is then processed through a complete pipeline,
including moving target indication (MTI), bulk Doppler compensation, and
Savitzky-Golay denoising, culminating in the generation of high-resolution
range-time map (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTMs) via both short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform (FSST). Finally, a novel
neural network method is proposed to validate the effectiveness of the radar
HAR. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the simulator successfully
generates high-fidelity and distinct micro-Doppler signature, which provides a
valuable tool for radar HAR algorithm design and validation. The installer of
this simulator is released at:

Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed
for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent
surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems.
Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G
networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for
scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral
efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption.
Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate
descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and
iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received
uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL)
approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach
also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more
lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with
supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully
CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with
adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature
selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to
jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation
results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral
efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point
operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the
proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and
hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.

Conclusion: 重构制拉拉天线系统能够实现更灵活的政策控制，但实际实现时需考虑天线位置和模型限制对性能的影响。

Abstract: A reconfigurable pinching-antenna system (PASS) is presented, endowing
pinching antennas (PAs) with both amplitude- and phase-controllable radiation
beyond conventional implementations. To characterize this feature, a general
and physically consistent model is established for PASS via multiport network
theory. Within this model, the fundamental constraint of ideal
reconfigurability of PAs is identified, allowing the full control of signal
amplitudes and phases. A practical directional-coupler (DC)-based PA model is
then proposed, enabling both amplitude-only control and amplitude-constrained
phase control. Beamforming optimization is investigated for both ideal and
practical cases: an optimal solution is obtained for ideal PAs, whereas a
high-quality iterative algorithm is developed for DC-based PAs. Numerical
results suggest that in single-user scenarios: (i) with optimized PA positions,
performance gains arise primarily from amplitude reconfigurability and DC-based
PAs approach ideal performance, and (ii) with fixed PA positions, both
amplitude and phase reconfigurability are critical and DC-based PAs incur
non-negligible loss.

Abstract: This paper studies a broadband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) system aided by a beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface
(BD-IRS), where inter-connections exist among different elements such that the
reflection matrix can exhibit a beyond diagonal structure. Under practical
circuit structures, the reflection matrix of the BD-IRS is generally dependent
on the circuit parameters (e.g., capacitance matrix for all tunable capacitors)
as well as the operating frequency, which leads to couplings among the BD-IRS
reflection matrices over different sub-carriers and consequently new challenges
in the BD-IRS design. Motivated by this, we first model the relationship
between the BD-IRS reflection matrices over different sub-carriers and the
tunable capacitance matrix, and then formulate the joint optimization problem
of the tunable capacitance matrix and power allocation over OFDM sub-carriers
to maximize the achievable rate of the OFDM system. Despite the non-convexity
of the problem, we propose an effective algorithm for finding a high-quality
feasible solution via leveraging alternating optimization and successive convex
approximation. Numerical results show the superiority of our proposed design
over benchmark designs.

Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of minimal $p$-encoders for
convolutional codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$, where $p$ is a prime. This
addresses a conjecture from \cite{k}, which posits that every such code admits
a minimal $p$-encoder, implying that all convolutional codes over
$\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ are noncatastrophic when input sequences are restricted to
coefficients in $\{0, \dots, p-1\}$. Our contributions include the introduction
of a new polynomial invariant that characterizes free codes, which enables us
to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a free code over
$\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ to be noncatastrophic in the usual sense (where input
coefficients are from $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$). Based on these findings, we affirm
the conjecture by providing a constructive method for obtaining a minimal
$p$-encoder for any convolutional code over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$.

Method: 提出了一系列纠错码构造方法：1）纠正任意位置单个转置错误的码族；2）二进制字母表上的改进构造；3）纠正常数个转置错误的码；4）纠正τn个转置错误的码构造；5）纠正所有可能转置模式的码构造

Result: 证明了所提码族具有渐近最优冗余度，获得了纠正常数个转置错误的码的基数界限，推导了最优码可达到的渐近率下界，给出了q元转置信道零错误容量的下界

Conclusion: 系统研究了转置错误的纠错问题，提出了多种有效的码构造方法并建立了相应的理论界限，为q元转置信道的编码设计提供了理论基础

Abstract: The problem of correcting transpositions (or swaps) of consecutive symbols in
$ q $-ary strings is studied. A family of codes correcting a transposition at
an arbitrary location is described and proved to have asymptotically optimal
redundancy. Additionally, an improved construction is given over a binary
alphabet. Bounds on the cardinality of codes correcting $ t = \textrm{const} $
transpositions are obtained. A lower bound on the achievable asymptotic rate of
optimal codes correcting $ t = \tau n $ transpositions is derived. Finally, a
construction of codes correcting all possible patterns of transpositions is
presented, and the corresponding lower bound on the zero-error capacity of the
$ q $-ary transposition channel is stated.

Abstract: This paper investigates streaming codes over three-node relay networks under
burst packet erasures with a delay constraint $T$. In any sliding window of
$T+1$ consecutive packets, the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination
channels may introduce burst erasures of lengths at most $b_1$ and $b_2$,
respectively. Singhvi et al. proposed a construction achieving the optimal code
rate when $\max\{b_1,b_2\}\mid (T-b_1-b_2)$. We construct streaming codes with
the optimal rate under the condition
  $T\geq b_1+b_2+\frac{b_1b_2}{|b_1-b_2|}$, thereby enriching the family of
rate-optimal streaming codes for three-node relay networks.

Motivation: 受到扭曲Reed-Solomon码和列扭曲Reed-Solomon码的启发，开发一种新的行列扭曲Reed-Solomon码类型，以扩展MDS码的学科家族

Method: 通过明确提供RCTRS码的MDS条件和存在性，并通过计算其Schur平方的维数来证明与其他码类的不等价性

Result: 成功构建了行列扭曲Reed-Solomon码，证明其具有MDS性质，并证明这些MDS码既不等价于传统Reed-Solomon码，也不等价于列扭曲Reed-Solomon码

Conclusion: 行列扭曲Reed-Solomon码构成了一个新的非RS MDS码家族，为MDS码的理论研究提供了新的构建方法和学科拓展

Abstract: In this article, we present a new class of codes known as row-column twisted
Reed-Solomon codes (abbreviated as RCTRS), motivated by the works of
\cite{beelen2017twisted} and \cite{liu2025column}. We explicitly provide
conditions for such codes to be MDS and also ensure their existence. By
determining the dimensions of their Schur squares, we prove that these MDS
codes are not equivalent to Reed-Solomon codes, thus presenting a new family of
non-RS MDS codes. Additionally, we prove that these MDS codes are also not
equivalent to column twisted Reed-Solomon codes described in
\cite{liu2025column}, showing the novelty of our construction.
