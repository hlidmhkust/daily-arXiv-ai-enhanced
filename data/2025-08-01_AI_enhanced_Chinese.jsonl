This paper presents a novel\ntransceiver that achieves high receiver sensitivity and low computational\ncomplexity. At the transmitter, we replace the conventional direct sequence\nspread spectrum (DSSS) preamble with a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) preamble,\nconsisting of a pair of down-chirp and up-chirp signals that are conjugate to\neach other, simplifying packet synchronization. For enhanced coverage, the\npayload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to\nmaintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to\nachieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak\ndetection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint\ndespreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while\nmaintaining simplicity in implementation. Furthermore, we optimize the preamble\ndetection threshold and spreading sequences for maximum non-coherent receiver\nperformance. The software-defined radio (SDR) prototype, developed using GNU\nRadio and USRP, along with operational snapshots, showcases its practical\nengineering applications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field-test\ntrials demonstrate that our transceiver outperforms traditional ones in terms\nof receiver sensitivity, while also being low in complexity and cost-effective\nfor LPWAN requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578bLPWAN\u6536\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CSS\u524d\u5bfc\u548cCPFSK-DSSS\u6df7\u5408\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u63a5\u6536\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLPWAN\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528CSS\u524d\u5bfc\u7b80\u5316\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CPFSK-DSSS\u8c03\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5cf0\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u975e\u76f8\u5e72\u89e3\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578b\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u4e3aLPWAN\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While AI has advanced automated\nsegmentation, current approaches typically target individual structures,\ncreating a fragmented landscape of incompatible models with varying performance\nand disparate evaluation protocols. Foundational segmentation models address\nthese limitations by providing a holistic anatomical view through a single\nmodel. Yet, robust clinical deployment demands comprehensive training data,\nwhich is lacking in existing whole-body approaches, both in terms of data\nheterogeneity and, more importantly, anatomical coverage. In this work, rather\nthan pursuing incremental optimizations in model architecture, we present CADS,\nan open-source framework that prioritizes the systematic integration,\nstandardization, and labeling of heterogeneous data sources for whole-body CT\nsegmentation. At its core is a large-scale dataset of 22,022 CT volumes with\ncomplete annotations for 167 anatomical structures, representing a significant\nadvancement in both scale and coverage, with 18 times more scans than existing\ncollections and 60% more distinct anatomical targets.

However, such resources are often limited due to\nprivacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic\nrepresentation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)\noffer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains\nunderexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in\nexisting skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a\nclinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike\nprior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on\nstructured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert\nannotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports.

This paper proposes an\nenvironmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the\ngenerative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target\nBSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM\ninference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.\nSpecifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free\nnetworks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM\nconstruction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N\nmodel is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any\npotential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by\nexploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same\nwireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to\nmulti-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same\nwireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit\ncorrelation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the\nproposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs.

This is achieved through the\ninterconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave\nreconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at\none port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local\ncontrol of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further\nenhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,\nchannel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among\nnon-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of\nNR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices\ncommunicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure\ntransmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses\nsignal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a\nphysics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural\nscattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,\nthe advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate\nan all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization\nalgorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS\nconsistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal\n(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two\nimpinging and reflection directions need to be supported.

Validation in a\nsimulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared\nto standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements\nin peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and\nbin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion.

At high frequencies, ELAAs shift\ncommunication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where\nspherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle\nand distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel\nestimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field\nscenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This\npaper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel\nestimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an\nelectromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences,\nalongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream\nnear-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major\nestimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations\n(single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and\nRIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among\nestimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide\ninsights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel\nestimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research\ndirections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e866G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6781\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff08ELAA\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u4e0e\u8fdc\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u6781\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\uff08ELAA\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u4ece\u8fdc\u573a\u8f6c\u5411\u8fd1\u573a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd1\u573a\u4e0e\u8fdc\u573a\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e3b\u6d41\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u4e0e\u8fdc\u573a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u968f\u540e\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a6G\u8fd1\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Paetzold", "Daniel Rueckert", "Bernhard Kainz"], "title": "Topology Optimization in Medical Image Segmentation with Fast Euler Characteristic", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown\npromising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice\nscore or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often\nfail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological\nconstraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.\nIn medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of\nthe required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the\npixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and\nconstrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology\n(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional\ndata due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and\n3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological\ncorrectness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u62c9\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6b27\u62c9\u7279\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u8fdd\u89c4\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u6821\u6b63\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u62c9\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
