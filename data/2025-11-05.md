### [1] [DiffPace: Diffusion-based Plug-and-play Augmented Channel Estimation in mmWave and Terahertz Ultra-Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01867)
*Zhengdong Hu,Chong Han,Wolfgang Gerstacker,Robert Schober*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DiffPace是一种基于扩散模型的即插即用信道估计方法，用于毫米波和太赫兹超大规模MIMO系统，能够在减少90%推理步骤的同时实现-15 dB的NMSE性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波和太赫兹通信面临严重的路径损耗，需要准确的信道估计。传统压缩感知方法无法有效捕捉混合近场和远场信道结构，导致性能下降。

Method: 使用扩散模型捕获基于混合球面波和平面波模型的信道分布，采用即插即用方法将DM作为先验知识，通过求解常微分方程进行推理以减少推理步骤。

Result: 在10 dB信噪比下达到-15 dB的归一化均方误差，相比最先进方案减少90%推理步骤，同时提供高估计精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: DiffPace在毫米波和太赫兹UM-MIMO系统中实现了竞争性的信道估计性能，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great
promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless
networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss
inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive
multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming
architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral
efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO
systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed
observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and
far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high
carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing
based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot
faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,
leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a
diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a
diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid
spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,
it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM
performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the
number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.
Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,
attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art
schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced
computational efficiency.

*HM Shadman Tabib,Md. Hasnaen Adil,Ayesha Rahman,Ahmmad Nur Swapnil,Maoyejatun Hasana,Ahmed Hossain Chowdhury,A. B. M. Alim Al Islam*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: NEUROSKY-EPI是首个用于癫痫研究的单通道消费级EEG开放数据集，结合EmbedCluster患者分层方法，展示了低成本EEG数据在资源受限环境中进行癫痫患者分层的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球许多地区缺乏临床多通道EEG访问，需要开发在资源受限环境下可部署的癫痫诊断工具。

Method: 提出EmbedCluster患者分层流程：从临床数据训练的EEGNet模型迁移表征，用上下文自编码器嵌入增强，基于EEG模式进行无监督患者聚类。

Result: 结果表明低成本单通道数据能够支持有意义的患者分层。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集和代码，推动跨学科研究，推进可负担、可操作的EEG癫痫护理目标，强调在资源受限环境中的可部署性、非专家可解释性以及隐私、包容性和偏见保护。

Abstract: Access to clinical multi-channel EEG remains limited in many regions
worldwide. We present NEUROSKY-EPI, the first open dataset of single-channel,
consumer-grade EEG for epilepsy, collected in a South Asian clinical setting
along with rich contextual metadata. To explore its utility, we introduce
EmbedCluster, a patient-stratification pipeline that transfers representations
from EEGNet models trained on clinical data and enriches them with contextual
autoencoder embeddings, followed by unsupervised clustering of patients based
on EEG patterns. Results show that low-cost, single-channel data can support
meaningful stratification. Beyond algorithmic performance, we emphasize
human-centered concerns such as deployability in resource-constrained
environments, interpretability for non-specialists, and safeguards for privacy,
inclusivity, and bias. By releasing the dataset and code, we aim to catalyze
interdisciplinary research across health technology, human-computer
interaction, and machine learning, advancing the goal of affordable and
actionable EEG-based epilepsy care.

### [3] [Design of an M-ary Chaos Shift Keying System Using Combined Chaotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01882)
*Tingting Huang,Jundong Chen,Huanqiang Zeng,Guofa Cai,Haoyu Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组合混沌序列的M元CSK系统，无需混沌同步，使用深度学习进行符号恢复，在AWGN和多径瑞利衰落信道中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CSK系统在噪声环境中实现混沌同步成本高且不实用，需要一种无需同步的替代方案。

Method: 通过组合两个不同混沌系统生成的混沌段构建混沌序列，仅用一种混沌段调制信息信号，接收端使用精心设计的深度学习二元分类器恢复信息符号。

Result: 在AWGN和多径瑞利衰落信道中评估SER性能，分析接收序列错位长度的影响，在多径瑞利衰落信道中相比现有CSK系统具有显著性能优势。

Conclusion: CCS-M-CSK系统是各种应用（包括V2X）的有前景候选方案。

Abstract: In traditional chaos shift keying (CSK) communication systems, implementing
chaotic synchronization techniques is costly but practically unattainable in a
noisy environment. This paper proposes a combined chaotic sequences-based
$M$-ary CSK (CCS-$M$-CSK) system that eliminates the need for chaotic
synchronization. At the transmitter, the chaotic sequence is constructed by
combining two chaotic segments of different lengths, where each is generated
from distinct chaotic systems and only one kind of chaotic segment modulates
the information signal. At the receiver, a deep learning unit with binary
classification is meticulously designed to recover information symbols. The
symbol error rate (SER) performance of the proposed system is evaluated over
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels.
Specifically, the impact of varying misalignment lengths on the SER performance
of the system is analyzed when the received sequence is misaligned.
Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrates significant performance
advantages over existing CSK-based systems in multipath Rayleigh fading
channels. These features establish CCS-$M$-CSK as a promising candidate for
various applications, including Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).

### [4] [A Comparison of Road Grade Preview Signals from Lidar and Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02006)
*Logan Schexnaydre,Aman Poovalappil,Darrell Robinette,Jeremy Bos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用车载激光雷达实时估计道路坡度的方法，通过卡尔曼滤波技术处理里程计和运动不确定性，与基于地图的系统相比具有相似精度，为自动驾驶车辆提供了更高的冗余性和独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制系统要么假设坡度只能通过车辆自身感知获得（无预览信号），要么完全依赖预建地图数据（可能缺失或过时），这两种假设都限制了控制系统的性能。

Method: 使用车载激光雷达采集的点云数据，通过计算前后轮轴在路径各点的高度差来估计坡度，并应用卡尔曼滤波技术来减轻里程计和运动不确定性对坡度估计的影响。

Result: 与基于GNSS/INS系统创建的地图测量相比，激光雷达估计器产生无偏误差，标准差为0.6度，平均范围为52.7米，精度与地图系统相当。

Conclusion: 激光雷达坡度估计系统在缺乏或不准确地图的情况下是有效的替代方案，为自动驾驶车辆提供了更高的冗余性和独立性。

Abstract: Road grade can impact the energy efficiency, safety, and comfort associated
with automated vehicle control systems. Currently, control systems that attempt
to compensate for road grade are designed with one of two assumptions. Either
the grade is only known once the vehicle is driving over the road segment
through proprioception, or complete knowledge of the oncoming road grade is
known from a pre-made map. Both assumptions limit the performance of a control
system, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation,
whereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to
missing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the
oncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use
point returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint
along a path. The estimated grade is defined as the difference in height
between the front and rear wheelbase at a given waypoint. Kalman filtering
techniques are used to mitigate the effects of odometry and motion uncertainty
on the grade estimates. This estimator's performance is compared to the
measurements of a map created with a GNSS/INS system via a field experiment.
When compared to the map-based system, the lidar-based estimator produces an
unbiased error with a standard deviation of 0.6 degrees at an average range of
52.7 meters. By having similar precision to map-based systems, automotive
lidar-based grade estimation systems are shown to be a valid approach for
measuring road grade when a map is unavailable or inaccurate. In using lidar as
an input signal for grade-based control system tasks, autonomous vehicles
achieve higher redundancy and independence in contrast to existing methods.

### [5] [Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-flow Routing in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02030)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习（DRL）的多跳路由框架，用于异构无线网络中的多数据流路由选择，通过联合选择通信技术、子带和中继节点来最大化路由速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用深度Q网络（DQN）的深度强化学习框架，每个节点联合选择通信技术、子带和下一跳中继，结合信道和干扰感知的邻居选择方法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该DRL路由框架在复杂异构无线网络场景中显著提高了可扩展性、适应性和端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的路由框架能够有效解决异构无线网络中的多跳路由问题，在各种网络动态变化下表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), where
devices with diverse communication technologies coexist, there is increasing
demand for efficient and adaptive multi-hop routing with multiple data flows.
Traditional routing methods, designed for homogeneous environments, fail to
address the complexity introduced by links consisting of multiple technologies,
frequency-dependent fading, and dynamic topology changes. In this paper, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing framework using deep
Q-networks (DQN) to establish routes between multiple source-destination pairs
in HWNs by enabling each node to jointly select a communication technology, a
subband, and a next hop relay that maximizes the rate of the route. Our
approach incorporates channel and interference-aware neighbor selection
approaches to improve decision-making beyond conventional distance-based
heuristics. We further evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the
proposed method under varying network dynamics, including node mobility,
changes in node density, and the number of data flows. Simulation results
demonstrate that our DRL-based routing framework significantly enhances
scalability, adaptability, and end-to-end throughput in complex HWN scenarios.

Abstract: Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines
(TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence
of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a
single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid
and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an
InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in
quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies
the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal
quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal
conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated
in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program
(PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system,
with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on
the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated
converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into
account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise,
series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT)
saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well
as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To
address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning
paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are
integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised
performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the
approach is effective in handling different system configurations and
conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在分子通信中具有实现鲁棒信号检测的潜力，噪声增强的模拟数据可以替代实验数据进行有效训练。

Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a promising paradigm for applications where
traditional electromagnetic communications are impractical. However, decoding
chemical signals, especially in multi-transmitter systems, remains a key
challenge due to interference and complex propagation dynamics. In this paper,
we develop a one-dimensional fractal convolutional neural network (fCNN) to
detect the concentrations of multiple types of molecules based on the
absorbance spectra measured at a receiver. Our model is trained by both
experimental and simulated datasets, with the latter enhanced by noise modeling
to mimic real-world measurements. We demonstrate that a noiseaugmented
simulated dataset can effectively be a substitute for experimental data,
achieving similar decoding accuracy. Our approach successfully detects bit
sequences in both binary and quadruple concentration shift keying (BCSK and
QCSK) scenarios, even when transmitters are desynchronized, highlighting the
potential of machine learning for robust MC signal detection.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的波束跟踪框架，结合位置感知波束预选策略和循环神经网络序列预测，在包含50%非视距场景的挑战性环境中实现高精度波束跟踪，同时减少50%的波束测量开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波通信虽然支持高速率但存在严重路径损耗，在车联网等动态场景中波束管理尤为困难，现有方法多在视距条件下评估，缺乏对非视距场景鲁棒性的严格测试。

Method: 使用位置感知波束预选策略结合循环神经网络进行序列预测，支持分类和回归两种深度学习模型训练方式。

Result: 在包含高达50%非视距场景的数据集上，该方法保持高top-K准确率，同时将波束测量开销减少50%。

Conclusion: 该深度学习框架在挑战性非视距环境下具有鲁棒性，能有效减少波束管理开销，适用于动态毫米波通信场景。

Abstract: Millimeter wave communications are essential for modern wireless networks. It
supports high data rates but suffers from severe path loss, which requires
precise beam alignment to maintain reliable links. This beam management is
particularly challenging in highly dynamic scenarios such as
vehicle-to-infrastructure, and several methods have been presented. In this
work, we propose a deep learning-based beam tracking framework that combines a
position-aware beam pre-selection strategy with sequential prediction using
recurrent neural networks. The proposed architecture can support deep learning
models trained for both classification and regression. In contrast to many
existing studies that evaluate beam tracking under predominantly line-of-sight
(LOS) conditions, our work explicitly includes highly challenging non-LOS
scenarios - with up to 50% non-LOS incidence in certain datasets - to
rigorously assess model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach maintains high top-K accuracy, even under adverse conditions, while
reducing the beam measurement overhead by up to 50%.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出LLM4PG模型，首次将大语言模型用于跨模态路径损耗地图生成，在6G AI原生通信系统中通过机器联觉实现更准确和泛化能力更强的路径损耗预测。


<details>

Conclusion: LLM4PG在路径损耗地图生成方面表现出更高的准确性和更强的跨条件泛化能力，验证了大语言模型在通信领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel large language model (LLM)-based pathloss map
generation model, termed LLM4PG, is proposed for sixth-generation (6G)
AI-native communication systems via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore
the mapping mechanism between sensing images and pathloss maps, a new synthetic
intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset, SynthSoM-U2G, is
constructed, covering multiple scenarios, frequency bands, and flight
altitudes. By adapting the LLM for cross-modal pathloss map generation for the
first time, LLM4PG establishes an effective cross-domain alignment between the
multi-modal sensing-communication and natural language domains. A task-specific
fine-tuning strategy with a tailored layer selection and activation scheme is
designed to meet the demands of massive-scale, high-quality generation.
Compared with conventional deep learning artificial intelligence generated
content (AIGC) models, LLM4PG achieves more accurate pathloss map generation
and stronger generalization across diverse conditions. Results show that LLM4PG
attains an NMSE of 0.0454, outperforming the conventional AIGC model by over
2.90 dB, while its cross-condition generalization achieves an NMSE of 0.0492,
exceeding the baseline by 4.52 dB.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Kullback-Leibler散度的新方法，在卡尔曼滤波框架中选择最合理的输入-参数-状态估计结果，通过比较先验和后验分布的信息增益来解决初始参数不确定性带来的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统识别中存在从不同初始参数猜测获得不同结果的不确定性，需要一种方法来选择最合理的结果。

Method: 首先对多个不同初始参数集执行卡尔曼滤波，然后使用Kullback-Leibler散度同时比较得到的后验分布与初始先验分布，最后选择具有最小K-L散度的识别结果。

Result: 该方法在线性、非线性和有限信息应用中都能选择性能更好的识别结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监测提供了一个强大的工具，能够有效选择最合理的参数估计结果。

Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined
herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state
estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification
suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from
different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the
information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior
distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for
a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system
input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior
distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the
least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most
plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better
performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information
applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

Motivation: 现有的IF-TEM采样器虽然功耗低，但采样效率有限。AIF-TEM通过自适应机制降低采样率，CIF-TEM通过压缩减少比特使用。将两者结合可以相互增强效果，实现更高效的采样。

Method: 设计了ACIF-TEM采样器，将自适应IF-TEM和压缩IF-TEM相结合，并提出了集成压缩阶段的无时钟时间数字转换器架构。

Result: 在真实音频信号测试中，ACIF-TEM在固定恢复MSE条件下，相比AIF-TEM节省至少3位（共9位），相比IF-TEM实现60%的压缩率，同时达到更低的均方误差。

Conclusion: ACIF-TEM采样器通过结合自适应和压缩技术，实现了在保持信号恢复精度的同时显著降低比特使用量的目标，为低功耗高效采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine (IF-TEM) is a power-efficient
asynchronous sampler that converts analog signals into non-uniform time-domain
samples. Adaptive IF-TEM (AIF-TEM) improves this machine by adapting its
process to the characteristics of the input signal, thereby reducing the
sampling rate. Compressed IF-TEM (CIF-TEM) reduces bit usage by performing
analog compression before quantization. In this paper, we introduce a combined
Adaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) -- a new sampler that leverages the two
machines, AIF-TEM and CIF-TEM, where each reinforces the effectiveness of the
other. We propose an efficient adaptive clockless time-to-digital converter
(TDC) architecture for the novel sampler that integrates the compression stage
within the TDC, facilitating the realization of the intended integrated system.
\ifconf \else We analyze the total bit usage, and contrast its performance with
that of IF-TEM, AIF-TEM, and CIF-TEM.\fi Via an evaluation study, we
demonstrate that the proposed ACIF-TEM sampler achieves lower Mean Square Error
(MSE) with fewer bits, offering compression gains of at least 3-bit out of
9-bits over AIF-TEM and 60\% compression over IF-TEM, for fixed recovery MSE
with real audio signals.

TL;DR: 该研究通过整合EEG和fNIRS信号，分析了26名参与者在N-back任务中不同心理负荷水平下的大脑连接性和信息流。研究发现高负荷时前额叶功能连接增强，且存在从EEG到fNIRS的显著方向性信息流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究心理负荷下的大脑网络动态特征，探索神经活动与血流动力学响应之间的耦合机制，验证EEG-fNIRS整合方法在认知负荷研究中的有效性。

Method: 使用N-back任务诱导不同心理负荷水平，从26名参与者的EEG和fNIRS信号中提取25个皮层区域，分别分析功能连接（PCC、PLV、MSC）和有效连接（dDTF、gPDC）。

Result: 高心理负荷（3-back）时前额叶区域功能连接增强；有效连接分析显示从EEG到fNIRS的显著方向性信息流；统计检验证实低高负荷状态间连接模式存在显著差异。

Conclusion: EEG-fNIRS整合能有效表征不同认知需求下的大脑网络动态，为理解心理负荷期间的神经血管耦合机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study investigates brain connectivity and information flow during mental
workload (MWL) by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. Utilizing the N-back task to induce
varying levels of MWL in 26 participants, we analyzed both functional and
effective connectivity across 25 cortical regions derived from combined EEG and
fNIRS signals. Functional connectivity was assessed using Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC), Phase Locking Value (PLV), and Magnitude Squared Coherence
(MSC), while effective connectivity was evaluated using directed Directed
Transfer Function (dDTF) and generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Our
findings reveal increased functional connectivity in frontal regions during
higher MWL conditions (3-back compared to 0-back). Furthermore, effective
connectivity analysis demonstrates a significant directional information flow
from EEG to fNIRS, indicating a dominant influence of neural activity on
hemodynamic responses. Statistical tests confirm significant differences in
connectivity patterns between low and high MWL states. These results underscore
the utility of EEG-fNIRS integration for characterizing brain network dynamics
under varying cognitive demands and provide insights into neurovascular
coupling mechanisms during mental workload.

<details>

Conclusion: 这是迈向可编程和物理基础的射频三维物体成分可视化的初步步骤。

Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has
intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the
limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion
or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose
electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and
compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts
reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments
(PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of
propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby
providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability,
this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object
reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach
combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that
infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features.
Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object
geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of
79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded
RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework
for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing
performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance
characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection
under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive
estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on
the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is
formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication
throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between
detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived
closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed
cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability
compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining
competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of
RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation
wireless networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成感知与通信(ISAC)是6G网络的关键技术，但实际实现面临全双工系统中的自干扰和有限块长度传输的性能下降等挑战。

Method: 采用交替优化和逐次凸近似方法，构建优化框架来最小化服务适应差距，同时确保感知可靠性。

Result: 数值结果表明，短块长度可实现快速适应但会增加雷达中断概率，长块长度可改善SINR但会因运动降低感知性能，存在一个最优平衡点。

Conclusion: RIS辅助优化能够找到块长度和波束形成器分配的最优平衡，实现可靠的通信和雷达感知联合性能。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and
environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant
challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems
and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite
blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users
while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in
both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to
minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via
alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results
show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from
fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow
motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and
beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum
in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance,
achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究通过眼动追踪分析比较了基线、正常能见度驾驶和低能见度驾驶三种条件下的视觉行为差异，发现低能见度显著影响注视稳定性和眨眼行为，并引入Guzik指数量化注视不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同能见度条件下驾驶员的眼动行为变化，特别是低能见度对视觉注意力和注视稳定性的影响，为驾驶安全提供科学依据。

Method: 使用31个眼动参数分析三种条件（基线、正常驾驶模拟、雾天驾驶模拟）下的眼动数据，包括13个扫视特征、13个BCEA参数和5个眨眼特征，并引入新的Guzik指数。

Result: 基线与驾驶条件间存在显著差异，低能见度条件下BCEA参数（9/13）和眨眼特征（4/5）变化明显，扫视特征变化较小（1/13）。新参数GI能有效量化注视不对称性。

Conclusion: 结合BCEA、扫视和眨眼参数能全面理解视觉注意力和注视稳定性，Guzik指数为不同能见度条件下的注视不对称性提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: This study investigates eye movement behaviour during three conditions:
Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated
drive under reduced visibility). Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31
parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate
Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the
analysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all
feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between
Baseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or
Fog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of
13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced
differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze
stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index
(GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the
BCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye
movement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other
parameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of
saccades: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and
standard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring
the influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters
provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability,
while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying
visibility conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统输出参数识别策略只能估计参数，无法同时估计输入和动态状态，限制了系统理解的完整性。需要一种能联合估计所有未知量的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段无迹卡尔曼滤波器：第一阶段用预测状态和参数估计输入，第二阶段用测量校正后的状态和参数进行最终估计。基于扰动分析证明系统可识别性。

Result: 该方法能够唯一识别具有至少一个零或非零已知输入的系统，实现动态状态、参数和输入的实时联合估计。

Conclusion: 该输出方法相比传统策略能更全面地理解系统，因为所有动态状态、参数和输入都能被联合实时估计。

Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman
filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown
input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted
dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input.
Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final
estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis
that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially
be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better
understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter
identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters,
and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对时间编码机器(TEMs)的非均匀量化(NUQ)方案，该方案基于触发间隔的概率分布设计，相比均匀量化(UQ)在相同比特预算下显著提升性能，且比非均匀采样(NUS)方案传输成本减半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工作主要分析触发间隔的均匀量化，但研究发现这些间隔本质上是非均匀分布的，因此需要设计专门的非均匀量化方案来优化性能。

Method: 推导了一类带限信号触发间隔的概率分布，并基于此分布设计了幂律非均匀量化方案。

Result: 仿真表明，在相同比特预算下，NUQ显著优于UQ；与同时需要量化幅度和时间的NUS相比，TEM-NUQ在传输成本减半的情况下实现了更低的误差。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了分布感知量化的优势，确立了TEM-NUQ作为传统UQ和NUS方案的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to
classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a
global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing
intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly
distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive
the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited
signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution.
Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same
bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both
amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves
lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the
advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an
efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种优化策略（量化和压缩）来降低神经网络接收器的计算成本和内存占用，同时保持优于传统接收器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络接收器虽然性能优异，但网络复杂度高、计算成本大，难以在硬件受限设备上部署，需要解决这一部署挑战。

Method: 引入均匀和非均匀量化（包括斐波那契码字量化FCQ），提出细粒度增量网络量化(INQ)策略来补偿量化损失，并开发两种无损压缩算法压缩冗余的斐波那契量化参数。

Result: 量化技术节省了45%的乘法器功耗和44%的面积，量化与压缩结合使内存占用减少63.4%，同时性能仍优于传统接收器。

Conclusion: 通过量化和压缩的组合优化，可以在显著降低硬件资源消耗的同时，保持神经网络接收器的性能优势。

Abstract: Neural receivers have shown outstanding performance compared to the
conventional ones but this comes with a high network complexity leading to a
heavy computational cost. This poses significant challenges in their deployment
on hardware-constrained devices. To address the issue, this paper explores two
optimization strategies: quantization and compression. We introduce both
uniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word
Quantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network
Quantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses
introduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we
introduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the
memory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters
characterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a
saving of 45\% and 44\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and
its combination with the compression determines a 63.4\% reduction in memory
footprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional
receiver.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型对于实际设计卫星间自由空间光通信系统非常有用，能够保证收敛性且计算开销最小。

Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology
for inter-satellite links (ISLs) due to its high data rate, low power
consumption, and reduced interference. However, the performance of
inter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While
pointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness
of PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment
hardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge,
this paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO
communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and
misalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation
with a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with
guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis
more practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite
FSO systems in practice.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC) service for mission-critical applications.
Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop
cooperative communication. In this paper, we develop an adaptive transmission
design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission
adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including
numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable
packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the
hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and
propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware
transmission (DRL-CoLA) algorithm to learn latency-aware transmission policies
in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm
achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency
requirements.

Conclusion: 可调的alpha公平机制在不同场景下提供了灵活的性能-公平性权衡控制。

Abstract: In this paper, cooperative energy recycling (CER) is investigated in
wireless-powered mobile edge computing systems. Unlike conventional
architectures that rely solely on a dedicated power source, wireless sensors
are additionally enabled to recycle energy from peer transmissions. To evaluate
system performance, a joint computation optimization problem is formulated that
integrates local computing and computation offloading, under an alpha-fairness
objective that balances total computable data and user fairness while
satisfying energy, latency, and task size constraints. Due to the inherent
non-convexity introduced by coupled resource variables and fairness
regularization, a variable-substitution technique is employed to transform the
problem into a convex structure, which is then efficiently solved using
Lagrangian duality and alternating optimization. To characterize the
fairness-efficiency tradeoff, closed-form solutions are derived for three
representative regimes: zero fairness, common fairness, and max-min fairness,
each offering distinct system-level insights. Numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed CER-enabled framework, demonstrating significant
gains in throughput and adaptability over benchmark schemes. The tunable alpha
fairness mechanism provides flexible control over performance-fairness
trade-offs across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: 基于变分推理的贝叶斯信道估计技术能有效应对毫米波MIMO系统中的脉冲干扰问题，提高信道估计性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a channel estimation problem in a downlink
millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which
suffers from impulsive interference caused by hardware non-idealities or
external disruptions. Specifically, impulsive interference presents a
significant challenge to channel estimation due to its sporadic, unpredictable,
and high-power nature. To tackle this issue, we develop a Bayesian channel
estimation technique based on variational inference (VI) that leverages the
sparsity of the mmWave channel in the angular domain and the intermittent
nature of impulsive interference to minimize channel estimation errors. The
proposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior
inference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms
baselines in terms of channel estimation accuracy.

Abstract: There are no universally accepted definitions of R\'enyi conditional entropy
and R\'enyi mutual information, although motivated by different applications,
several definitions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we
consider a family of two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy and a family of
two-parameter R\'enyi mutual information. By performing a change of variables
for the parameters, the two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy we study
coincides precisely with the definition introduced by Hayashi and Tan [IEEE
Trans. Inf. Theory, 2016], and it also emerges naturally as the classical
specialization of the three-parameter quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy
recently put forward by Rubboli, Goodarzi, and Tomamichel [arXiv:2410.21976
(2024)]. We establish several fundamental properties of the two-parameter
R\'enyi conditional entropy, including monotonicity with respect to the
parameters and variational expression. The associated two-parameter R\'enyi
mutual information considered in this paper is new and it unifies three
commonly used variants of R\'enyi mutual information. For this quantity, we
prove several important properties, including the non-negativity, additivity,
data processing inequality, monotonicity with respect to the parameters,
variational expression, as well as convexity and concavity. Finally, we
demonstrate that these two-parameter R\'enyi information quantities can be used
to characterize the strong converse exponents in privacy amplification and soft
covering problems under R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha \in (0, \infty)$.

Abstract: The increasing spectral reuse can cause significant performance degradation
due to interference from neighboring cells. In such scenarios, developing
effective interference suppression schemes is necessary to improve overall
system performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel user
equipment-centric interference suppression scheme, which effectively detects
inter-cell interference (ICI) and subsequently applies interference whitening
to mitigate ICI. The proposed scheme, named Z-refined deep support vector data
description, exploits a one-class classification-based anomaly detection
technique. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms
various baselines in terms of interference detection performance with limited
time or frequency resources for training and is comparable to the performance
based on an ideal genie-aided interference suppression scheme. Furthermore, we
demonstrate through test equipment experiments using a commercial
fifth-generation modem chipset that the proposed scheme shows performance
improvements across various 3rd generation partnership project standard channel
environments, including tapped delay line-A, -B, and -C models.

Abstract: We investigate additive cyclic codes over the alphabet
$\mathbb{F}_{q}\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q$ is a prime power. First, its
generator polynomials and minimal spanning set are determined. Then, examples
of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-additive cyclic codes that satisfy the well-known
Singleton bound are constructed. Using a Gray map, we produce certain optimal
linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$. Finally, we obtain a few optimal ternary
linear complementary dual (LCD) codes from
$\mathbb{F}_{3}\mathbb{F}_{9}$-additive codes.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个双参数变换族，扩展了上下变换的概念，定义了新的信息泛函（下矩和累积上矩），建立了这些新泛函与经典信息度量（矩、Rényi熵、Shannon熵、Fisher信息）之间的尖锐不等式，并定义了新的统计复杂度度量。


<details>

Motivation: 扩展上下变换理论，引入新的信息泛函来连接概率分布的矩和Rényi熵，探索信息理论中不同度量之间的深层关系。

Method: 通过双参数变换族定义下矩和累积上矩，建立这些新泛函与经典信息度量的不等式关系，并分析最优边界和最小化密度。

Result: 获得了新的尖锐不等式，发现下矩在某些情况下提供了p阶矩和幂Rényi熵之间的插值，确定了最优边界和最小化密度（用广义三角函数表示）。

Conclusion: 新变换族揭示了信息泛函之间复杂的结构关系，通过代数共轭变换建立了统计复杂度度量的单调性，丰富了信息不等式理论。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a biparametric family of transformations which can
be seen as an extension of the so-called up and down transformations. This new
class of transformations allows to us to introduce new informational
functionals, which we have called \textit{down-moments} and \textit{cumulative
upper-moments}. A remarkable fact is that the down-moments provide, in some
cases, an interpolation between the $p$-th moments and the power R\'enyi
entropies of a probability density. We establish new and sharp inequalities
relating these new functionals to the classical informational measures such as
moments, R\'enyi and Shannon entropies and Fisher information measures. We also
give the optimal bounds as well as the minimizing densities, which are in some
cases expressed in terms of the generalized trigonometric functions. We
furthermore define new classes of measures of statistical complexity obtained
as quotients of the new functionals, and establish monotonicity properties for
them through an algebraic conjugation of up and down transformations. All of
these properties highlight an intricate structure of functional inequalities.

TL;DR: 本文改进了Chen和Xie建立的线性反码的antiGriesmer界，去除了码长限制并将对偶码最小距离条件从≥3放宽到≥2。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的线性反码antiGriesmer界，扩大其适用范围，为研究线性反码及其性质提供更全面的框架。

Method: 证明对于任意[n,k]_q线性反码C，若其对偶码最小距离d(C^⊥)≥2，则不等式n ≤ ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} ⌊δ/q^i⌋成立。

Result: 得到了更通用的antiGriesmer界，推导出关于直径δ、码长n和维数k的多个推论，并展示了新界比先前界更尖锐的例子。

Conclusion: 新界统一并扩展了早期发现，显著拓宽了antiGriesmer界的适用性，在线性码构造和分类中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This paper improves the antiGriesmer bound for linear anticodes previously
established by Chen and Xie (Journal of Algebra, 673 (2025) 304-320). While the
original bound required the code length to satisfy $n < q^{k-1}$ and the dual
code to have minimum distance at least 3, our main result removes the length
restriction and relaxes the dual distance condition to at least 2.
Specifically, we prove that for any $[n,k]_q$ linear anticode $\mathcal{C}$
over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with diameter $\delta$ and $d(\mathcal{C}^\perp) \geq 2$,
the inequality \[ n \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lfloor \frac{\delta}{q^i}
\right\rfloor \] holds. This generalization significantly broadens the
applicability of the antiGriesmer bound. We derive several corollaries,
including lower bounds on the diameter $\delta$ in terms of $n$ and $k$, upper
bounds on the code length $n$, and constraints on the dimension $k$.
Applications to the construction and classification of linear codes with few
weights are also discussed, along with examples demonstrating that our new
bound can be sharper than previous ones. Our work unifies and extends earlier
findings, providing a more comprehensive framework for studying linear
anticodes and their properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全相关衰落条件下，由于缺乏FAS信道的闭式分布，推导准确且易于处理的性能表达式具有挑战性。

Method: 使用极值分布建模FAS信道，首先采用Gumbel分布近似，然后扩展到广义极值分布，通过最大似然准则确定参数。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于GEV的框架比Gumbel模型具有更高的准确性，两种EVD方法都为相关衰落条件下的FAS性能评估提供了计算高效且分析易处理的工具。

Conclusion: 提出的基于极值分布的框架为完全相关瑞利衰落下的FAS性能评估提供了准确且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In single-antenna fluid antenna systems (FASs), the transceiver dynamically
selects the antenna port with the strongest instantaneous channel to enhance
link reliability. However, deriving accurate yet tractable performance
expressions under fully correlated fading remains challenging, primarily due to
the absence of a closed-form distribution for the FAS channel. To address this
gap, this paper develops a novel performance evaluation framework for FAS
operating under fully correlated Rayleigh fading, by modeling the FAS channel
through extreme value distributions (EVDs). We first justify the suitability of
EVD modeling and approximate the FAS channel through the Gumbel distribution,
with parameters expressed as functions of the number of ports and the antenna
aperture size via the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. Closed-form
expressions for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are then
derived. While the Gumbel model provides an excellent fit, minor deviations
arise in the extreme-probability regions. To further improve accuracy, we
extend the framework using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and
obtain closed-form OP and EC approximations based on ML-derived parameters.
Simulation results confirm that the proposed GEV-based framework achieves
superior accuracy over the Gumbel-based model, while both EVD-based approaches
offer computationally efficient and analytically tractable tools for evaluating
the performance of FAS under realistic correlated fading conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文通过应用部分信息分解(PID)分析Hopfield网络，发现神经元活动信息在记忆容量下具有高冗余性，并基于此提出冗余最大化作为学习目标，显著提升了网络记忆容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hopfield网络的局部计算原理尚未完全理解，需要形式化表征此类系统中的局部信息处理机制。

Method: 应用部分信息分解(PID)框架分析Hopfield网络中单个神经元的信息处理，将冗余性作为信息论学习目标进行优化。

Result: 优化冗余性后，网络记忆容量从0.14提升到1.59，比传统Hopfield网络提高超过10倍，甚至优于最新的Hopfield网络实现。

Conclusion: 冗余最大化可作为联想记忆的新设计原则，为基于信息论目标的新型联想记忆模型开辟了途径。

Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the
retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the
local computational principles which are required to enable this function
remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information
processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory
- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of
different inputs to an output into unique information from each input,
redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges
from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons
in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the
information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between
the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and
unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and
performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as
an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each
neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more
than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks
and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield
networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new
design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new
associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

*Ismail Cosandal,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究马尔可夫链在传输时间和状态转移时间尺度相同条件下的源编码问题，提出基于最后传输符号及其传输时长的最优源编码策略，通过MDP建模并比较Huffman基准策略，证明最优策略能降低平均传输时长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统源编码假设传输时间远小于状态转移时间，但在实际系统中两者可能处于相同时间尺度。当每个比特传输占用一个时隙且马尔可夫链在同一时隙更新状态时，码字长度会影响未传输符号数量和下一符号概率分布，需要新的编码策略。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在符号基础上增加传输时长作为状态变量，提出基于最后传输符号及其传输时长的最优源编码策略，并与两种Huffman基准策略进行性能比较。

Result: 在随机生成的马尔可夫过程中，提出的最优策略相比基准策略能够降低平均传输时长，性能提升程度取决于马尔可夫过程的参数特性。

Conclusion: 在传输时间和状态转移时间尺度相同的场景下，考虑传输时长影响的源编码策略优于传统Huffman编码，证明了时间尺度假设对编码性能的重要影响。

Abstract: We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption
that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state
happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of
each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in
the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol
determines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability
of the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the
average transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal
source coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission
duration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov
decision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission
duration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark
policies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We
observe that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy
decreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The
performance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process.

Conclusion: 该构造方法能够产生无限族的自正交准循环码，为量子纠错码的设计提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Quasi-cyclic codes have been recently employed in the constructions of
quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we propose a construction of
infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect
to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension
and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their
constituent codes defined over field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also show
that the lower bound for the minimum distance satisfies the square-root-like
lower bound and also show how self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can arise from our
construction. Using the CSS construction, we show the existence of quantum
error-correcting codes with good parameters.

Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic
back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional
end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited
by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage
strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs):
first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end
implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its
first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory
demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to
end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage
design achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training under the same
training time and resource constraints.

Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems
for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata
standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This
heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the
generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We
present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias
quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,
image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies
metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive
review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography
datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to
three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify
substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.
Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models
trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation
compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and
mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training
corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain
generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for
bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and
advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across
diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is
publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.

Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis.
Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to
variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently,
a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across
diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the
clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can
improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or
require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE
(Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised
framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback
during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image
annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality
scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on
humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from
TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement
methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation
time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained significant attention for high-fidelity image
generation. Our work investigates the potential of exploiting diffusion models
for adversarial robustness in image classification and object detection.
Adversarial attacks challenge standard models in these tasks by perturbing
inputs to force incorrect predictions. To address this issue, many approaches
use training schemes for forcing the robustness of the models, which increase
training costs. In this work, we study models built on top of off-the-shelf
diffusion models and demonstrate their practical significance: they provide a
low-cost path to robust representations, allowing lightweight heads to be
trained on frozen features without full adversarial training. Our empirical
evaluations on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and PASCAL VOC show that diffusion-based
classifiers and detectors achieve meaningful adversarial robustness with
minimal compute. While clean and adversarial accuracies remain below
state-of-the-art adversarially trained CNNs or ViTs, diffusion pretraining
offers a favorable tradeoff between efficiency and robustness. This work opens
a promising avenue for integrating diffusion models into resource-constrained
robust deployments.
