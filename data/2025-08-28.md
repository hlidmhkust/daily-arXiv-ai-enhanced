*Cunmin Zhao,Ziyuan Luo,Guoye Guan,Zelin Li,Yiming Ma,Zhongying Zhao,Renjie Wan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CellINR框架通过隐式神经表示和盲卷积技术，有效解决4D活细胞荧光显微镜中的光漂白和光毒性问题，实现高精度细胞结构重建和伪影去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D活细胞荧光显微镜中高强度照明导致光漂白和光毒性效应，产生光诱导伪影，严重影响图像连续性和细节恢复。

Method: 基于隐式神经表示的案例特定优化方法，采用盲卷积和结构放大策略，将3D空间坐标映射到高频域，精确建模细胞结构并区分真实信号与伪影。

Result: CellINR在伪影去除和结构连续性恢复方面显著优于现有技术，首次提供配对的4D活细胞成像数据集用于重建性能评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为后续定量分析和生物学研究提供了坚实基础，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: 4D live fluorescence microscopy is often compromised by prolonged high
intensity illumination which induces photobleaching and phototoxic effects that
generate photo-induced artifacts and severely impair image continuity and
detail recovery. To address this challenge, we propose the CellINR framework, a
case-specific optimization approach based on implicit neural representation.
The method employs blind convolution and structure amplification strategies to
map 3D spatial coordinates into the high frequency domain, enabling precise
modeling and high-accuracy reconstruction of cellular structures while
effectively distinguishing true signals from artifacts. Experimental results
demonstrate that CellINR significantly outperforms existing techniques in
artifact removal and restoration of structural continuity, and for the first
time, a paired 4D live cell imaging dataset is provided for evaluating
reconstruction performance, thereby offering a solid foundation for subsequent
quantitative analyses and biological research. The code and dataset will be
public.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 深度学习框架用于腹主动脉肠胸穹的弹性成像，通过超声测量移动场来预测管壁硬度，以更准确评估破裂风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最大直径法无法反映血管壁材料特性，而这些特性对肠胸穹破裂风险评估至关重要

Method: 使用有限元模拟生成数据集，基于U-Net网络构造深度学习模型，通过轴向和侧向移动场分量预测空间模量分布

Result: 在数字幻象数据中NMSE达到0.73%，物理幻象实验中模型比率与预期值符合，计算效率显著高于迭代方法

Conclusion: 深度学习方法能够从超声图像快速预测细织硬度，为无创肠胸穹破裂风险评估提供有效工具

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) pose a significant clinical risk due to
their potential for rupture, which is often asymptomatic but can be fatal.
Although maximum diameter is commonly used for risk assessment, diameter alone
is insufficient as it does not capture the properties of the underlying
material of the vessel wall, which play a critical role in determining the risk
of rupture. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning-based
framework for elasticity imaging of AAAs with 2D ultrasound. Leveraging finite
element simulations, we generate a diverse dataset of displacement fields with
their corresponding modulus distributions. We train a model with U-Net
architecture and normalized mean squared error (NMSE) to infer the spatial
modulus distribution from the axial and lateral components of the displacement
fields. This model is evaluated across three experimental domains: digital
phantom data from 3D COMSOL simulations, physical phantom experiments using
biomechanically distinct vessel models, and clinical ultrasound exams from AAA
patients. Our simulated results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning
model is able to reconstruct modulus distributions, achieving an NMSE score of
0.73\%. Similarly, in phantom data, the predicted modular ratio closely matches
the expected values, affirming the model's ability to generalize to phantom
data. We compare our approach with an iterative method which shows comparable
performance but higher computation time. In contrast, the deep learning method
can provide quick and effective estimates of tissue stiffness from ultrasound
images, which could help assess the risk of AAA rupture without invasive
procedures.

### [3] [MedVQA-TREE: A Multimodal Reasoning and Retrieval Framework for Sarcopenia Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19319)
*Pardis Moradbeiki,Nasser Ghadiri,Sayed Jalal Zahabi,Uffe Kock Wiil,Kristoffer Kittelmann Brockhattingen,Ali Ebrahimi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MedVQA-TREE是一个多模态框架，通过分层图像解释、门控特征融合和多跳多查询检索策略，在超声图像上实现了99%的肌少症诊断准确率，比现有方法提升10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前肌少症的超声诊断面临挑战：成像线索细微、标注数据有限、模型缺乏临床上下文信息。需要结合结构化视觉理解和临床知识检索来提升诊断效果。

Method: 采用分层图像解释模块（解剖分类、区域分割、图空间推理）、门控特征级融合机制、以及基于UMLS的多跳多查询检索策略，整合视觉特征与文本查询，访问PubMed和肌少症专业知识库。

Result: 在两个公开MedVQA数据集（VQA-RAD和PathVQA）和自定义肌少症超声数据集上评估，达到99%的诊断准确率，比之前最先进方法提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 结合结构化视觉理解和引导式知识检索的方法，能有效提升AI辅助肌少症诊断的效果，证明了多模态框架在医学视觉问答中的价值。

Abstract: Accurate sarcopenia diagnosis via ultrasound remains challenging due to
subtle imaging cues, limited labeled data, and the absence of clinical context
in most models. We propose MedVQA-TREE, a multimodal framework that integrates
a hierarchical image interpretation module, a gated feature-level fusion
mechanism, and a novel multi-hop, multi-query retrieval strategy. The vision
module includes anatomical classification, region segmentation, and graph-based
spatial reasoning to capture coarse, mid-level, and fine-grained structures. A
gated fusion mechanism selectively integrates visual features with textual
queries, while clinical knowledge is retrieved through a UMLS-guided pipeline
accessing PubMed and a sarcopenia-specific external knowledge base. MedVQA-TREE
was trained and evaluated on two public MedVQA datasets (VQA-RAD and PathVQA)
and a custom sarcopenia ultrasound dataset. The model achieved up to 99%
diagnostic accuracy and outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods by over
10%. These results underscore the benefit of combining structured visual
understanding with guided knowledge retrieval for effective AI-assisted
diagnosis in sarcopenia.

### [4] [AT-CXR: Uncertainty-Aware Agentic Triage for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19322)
*Xueyang Li,Mingze Jiang,Gelei Xu,Jun Xia,Mengzhao Jia,Danny Chen,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AT-CXR是一个不确定性感知的胸部X光分流代理系统，通过估计置信度和分布拟合度，在自动决策和人工干预之间做出智能选择，在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在医疗影像分流中真正自主决策（何时停止、升级或延迟）的研究相对不足，特别是在真实临床约束条件下。

Method: 开发了两种路由器设计：确定性规则路由器和LLM决策路由器，共享相同输入和动作，通过逐步策略进行自动化决策或建议人工干预标签。

Result: 在NIH ChestX-ray14数据集上，两种变体均优于零样本视觉语言模型和最先进的监督分类器，实现了更高的全覆盖准确率和更好的选择性预测性能，同时满足临床延迟约束。

Conclusion: 两种路由器提供了互补的操作点，使部署能够优先考虑最大吞吐量或最大准确性，为临床实践提供了实用的自动化分流解决方案。

Abstract: Agentic AI is advancing rapidly, yet truly autonomous medical-imaging triage,
where a system decides when to stop, escalate, or defer under real constraints,
remains relatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AT-CXR, an
uncertainty-aware agent for chest X-rays. The system estimates per-case
confidence and distributional fit, then follows a stepwise policy to issue an
automated decision or abstain with a suggested label for human intervention. We
evaluate two router designs that share the same inputs and actions: a
deterministic rule-based router and an LLM-decided router. Across five-fold
evaluation on a balanced subset of NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, both variants
outperform strong zero-shot vision-language models and state-of-the-art
supervised classifiers, achieving higher full-coverage accuracy and superior
selective-prediction performance, evidenced by a lower area under the
risk-coverage curve (AURC) and a lower error rate at high coverage, while
operating with lower latency that meets practical clinical constraints. The two
routers provide complementary operating points, enabling deployments to
prioritize maximal throughput or maximal accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/XLIAaron/uncertainty-aware-cxr-agent.

### [5] [MRExtrap: Longitudinal Aging of Brain MRIs using Linear Modeling in Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19482)
*Jaivardhan Kapoor,Jakob H. Macke,Christian F. Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MRExtrap是一种基于卷积自编码器潜在空间线性建模的脑MRI老化模拟方法，通过线性外推预测未来脑部扫描，在ADNI数据集上表现优于GAN基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的生成模型通常从单次扫描预测未来脑部变化，但研究发现自编码器训练的潜在空间中老化轨迹近似线性，这为更简单有效的建模提供了机会。

Method: 训练脑MRI自编码器创建潜在空间，通过估计潜在进展率β进行基于年龄的线性外推预测。提出使用群体平均和个体特异性先验，并支持贝叶斯后验采样进行多扫描条件预测。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，MRExtrap准确预测老化模式，在单体积脑老化预测方面优于GAN基线方法。潜在进展率与疾病和年龄相关的结构萎缩模式相关。

Conclusion: MRExtrap提供了一种简单可靠的基于年龄的3D脑MRI生成方法，特别适用于具有多个纵向观察数据的场景，为神经退行性疾病进展研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Simulating aging in 3D brain MRI scans can reveal disease progression
patterns in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Current deep
learning-based generative models typically approach this problem by predicting
future scans from a single observed scan. We investigate modeling brain aging
via linear models in the latent space of convolutional autoencoders (MRExtrap).
Our approach, MRExtrap, is based on our observation that autoencoders trained
on brain MRIs create latent spaces where aging trajectories appear
approximately linear. We train autoencoders on brain MRIs to create latent
spaces, and investigate how these latent spaces allow predicting future MRIs
through linear extrapolation based on age, using an estimated latent
progression rate $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. For single-scan prediction, we propose
using population-averaged and subject-specific priors on linear progression
rates. We also demonstrate that predictions in the presence of additional scans
can be flexibly updated using Bayesian posterior sampling, providing a
mechanism for subject-specific refinement. On the ADNI dataset, MRExtrap
predicts aging patterns accurately and beats a GAN-based baseline for
single-volume prediction of brain aging. We also demonstrate and analyze
multi-scan conditioning to incorporate subject-specific progression rates.
Finally, we show that the latent progression rates in MRExtrap's linear
framework correlate with disease and age-based aging patterns from previously
studied structural atrophy rates. MRExtrap offers a simple and robust method
for the age-based generation of 3D brain MRIs, particularly valuable in
scenarios with multiple longitudinal observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球主要公共卫生问题，早期准确诊断至关重要。患者访谈中的语音、语言和行为线索可能提供客观标记来支持临床评估

Method: 开发了整合患者访谈特征（语音模式、语言特征和结构化临床信息）的诊断方法。为每种模态训练单独模型，然后通过多模态融合结合，以反映真实世界精神病学评估的复杂性

Abstract: Background: Depression is a major public health concern, affecting an
estimated five percent of the global population. Early and accurate diagnosis
is essential to initiate effective treatment, yet recognition remains
challenging in many clinical contexts. Speech, language, and behavioral cues
collected during patient interviews may provide objective markers that support
clinical assessment.
  Methods: We developed a diagnostic approach that integrates features derived
from patient interviews, including speech patterns, linguistic characteristics,
and structured clinical information. Separate models were trained for each
modality and subsequently combined through multimodal fusion to reflect the
complexity of real-world psychiatric assessment. Model validity was assessed
with established performance metrics, and further evaluated using calibration
and decision-analytic approaches to estimate potential clinical utility.
  Results: The multimodal model achieved superior diagnostic accuracy compared
to single-modality models, with an AUROC of 0.88 and an F1-score of 0.75.
Importantly, the fused model demonstrated good calibration and offered higher
net clinical benefit compared to baseline strategies, highlighting its
potential to assist clinicians in identifying patients with depression more
reliably.
  Conclusion: Multimodal analysis of patient interviews using machine learning
may serve as a valuable adjunct to psychiatric evaluation. By combining speech,
language, and clinical features, this approach provides a robust framework that
could enhance early detection of depressive disorders and support
evidence-based decision-making in mental healthcare.

### [7] [1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408)

Conclusion: 该研究成功扩展了1位采样技术，通过变换域方法解决了传统限制，为高性能低功耗ADC设计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal
acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently
constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a
trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy
consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit
depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with
low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with
Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However,
SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to
handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF)
addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware,
resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a
novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and
USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise
shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited
signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains.
(2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery
method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method
demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques,
offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive
numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a
broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.

Abstract: Carrier Aggregation (CA) is a technique used in 5G and previous cellular
generations to temporarily increase the data rate of a specific user during
peak demand periods or to reduce carrier congestion. CA is achieved by
combining two or more carriers and providing a virtual, wider overall bandwidth
to high-demand users of the system. CA was introduced in the 4G/LTE wireless
era and has been proven effective in 5G as well, where it is said to play a
significant role in efficient network capacity management. Given this success,
the satellite communication (SatCom) community has put its attention into CA
and the potential benefits it can bring in terms of better spectrum utilization
and better meeting the user traffic demand. While the theoretical evaluation of
CA for SatCom has already been presented in several works, this article
presents the design and results obtained with an experimentation testbed based
on Software Defined Radio (SDR) and a satellite channel emulator. We first
present the detailed implementation design, which includes a Gateway (GW)
module responsible for PDU-scheduling across the aggregated carriers, and a
User Terminal (UT) module responsible for aggregating the multiple received
streams. The second part of the article presents the experimental evaluation,
including CA over a single Geostationary (GEO) satellite, CA over a single
Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite, and CA combining carriers sent over GEO and
MEO satellites. A key contribution of this work is the explicit consideration
of multi-orbit scenarios in the testbed design and validation. The testing
results show promising benefits of CA over SatCom systems, motivating potential
upcoming testing on over-the-air systems.

*Si Wang,Guoqiang Xiao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于不同形式四阶差联合阵列的新型四阶层次阵列设计方法，通过结合多种FODCA形式增加自由度并抑制传感器间互耦效应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于圆形四阶累积量的阵列设计采用单一形式的四阶差联合阵列，限制了可获得的自由度且忽略了物理传感器间互耦的影响

Method: 使用任意生成器集构建基于不同形式FODCA的新型四阶层次阵列(FOHA)，推导生成器与结果FOHA之间的耦合泄漏解析表达式，提出两种具有闭式传感器布局的具体FOHA配置

Result: 所提阵列不仅为DOA估计提供更多自由度以分辨更多信源，还能有效抑制互耦效应，相比现有FODCA阵列具有更低冗余度和更好性能

Conclusion: 数值仿真验证FOHA相比其他稀疏线性阵列具有更优越的DOA估计性能，提供了增强的自由度和改进的抗互耦鲁棒性

Abstract: Conventional array designs based on circular fourth-order cumulant typically
adopt a single expression form of the fourth-order difference co-array (FODCA),
which limits the achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs) and neglects the impact
of mutual coupling among physical sensors. To address above issues, this paper
proposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining
different forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel
fourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is
constructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between
the coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two
specific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements.
The arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in
direction of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual
coupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that
arrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to
existing arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient
conditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with
existing arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and
improved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that
FOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse
linear arrays.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出一种多波导链提天线系统(PASS)辅助的集成感知与通信(ISAC)系统，通过交替优化算法最小化目标感知的Cramer-Rao下界，在满足通信质量、功率预算和天线部署约束的前提下实现优称性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链提天线系统(PASS)在灵活部署和减少信号传播损耗方面具有优势，因此被应用于集成感知与通信(ISAC)系统以提升系统性能。

Method: 采用全双工基站，通过波导上的链提天线发射通信和感知信号，用均匀线性数组收集回波信号。使用交替优化(AO)方法解决非凸优化问题，包括数字样形子问题(使用半正定松弛法)和链提样形子问题(使用逐步凸近似、罚函数法和元素级优化)。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效的PASS辅助ISAC系统，通过创新的优化算法实现了感知准确性的显著提升，为未来无线通信系统的感通一体化提供了有力的技术支撑。

Abstract: Recently, the pinching antenna system (PASS) has attracted considerable
attention due to their advantages in flexible deployment and reduction of
signal propagation loss. In this work, a multiple waveguide PASS assisted
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, where the base
station (BS) is equipped with transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and
receiving uniform linear array (ULA) antennas. The full-duplex (FD) BS
transmits the communication and sensing signals through the PAs on waveguides
and collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this
configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is
formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power
budget constraint, and PA deployment constraints. The alternating optimization
(AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization
problem. In each iteration, the overall optimization problem is decomposed into
a digital beamforming sub-problem and a pinching beamforming sub-problem. The
sensing covariance matrix and communication beamforming matrix at the BS are
optimized by solving the digital beamforming sub-problem with semidefinite
relaxation (SDR). The PA deployment is updated by solving the pinching
beamforming sub-problem with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method,
penalty method, and element-wise optimization. Simulation results show that the
proposed PASS assisted ISAC framework achieves superior performance over
benchmark schemes, is less affected by stringent communication constraints
compared to conventional MIMO-ISAC, and benefits further from increasing the
number of waveguides and PAs per waveguide.

Abstract: The development of Large AI Models (LAMs) for wireless communications,
particularly for complex tasks like spectrum sensing, is critically dependent
on the availability of vast, diverse, and realistic datasets. Addressing this
need, this paper introduces the ChangShuoRadioData (CSRD) framework, an
open-source, modular simulation platform designed for generating large-scale
synthetic radio frequency (RF) data. CSRD simulates the end-to-end transmission
and reception process, incorporating an extensive range of modulation schemes
(100 types, including analog, digital, OFDM, and OTFS), configurable channel
models featuring both statistical fading and site-specific ray tracing using
OpenStreetMap data, and detailed modeling of realistic RF front-end impairments
for various antenna configurations (SISO/MISO/MIMO). Using this framework, we
characterize CSRD2025, a substantial dataset benchmark comprising over
25,000,000 frames (approx. 200TB), which is approximately 10,000 times larger
than the widely used RML2018 dataset. CSRD2025 offers unprecedented signal
diversity and complexity, specifically engineered to bridge the Sim2Real gap.
Furthermore, we provide processing pipelines to convert IQ data into
spectrograms annotated in COCO format, facilitating object detection approaches
for time-frequency signal analysis. The dataset specification includes
standardized 8:1:1 training, validation, and test splits (via frame indices) to
ensure reproducible research. The CSRD framework is released at
https://github.com/Singingkettle/ChangShuoRadioData to accelerate the
advancement of AI-driven spectrum sensing and management.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度强化学习和脉冲神经网络的能源效率高的调通感知聚焦方案，用于V2X网络中的材料感知和通信聚合优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决V2X网络中传统学习方案能源消耗高的问题，同时确保动态场景下的通信吞吐量和感知准确性

Result: 模拟结果证实该方法实现了显著的能源节省和优异的通信性能，同时保持了健壮的性能

Conclusion: 该方法具有支持未来V2X系统实现绿色可持续连接的潜力

Abstract: This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically,
we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov
Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate
beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby
eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel
state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring
both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario.
To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we
embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their
event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance
energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and
superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support
green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.

Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance
error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This
letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding
framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a
low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy
check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding
(WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized
sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This
strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise
ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an
excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing
it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.

Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer a promising alternative to rigid
silicon-based hardware for wearable healthcare devices, enabling lightweight,
conformable, and low-cost systems. However, their limited integration density
and large feature sizes impose strict area and power constraints, making
ML-based healthcare systems-integrating analog frontend, feature extraction and
classifier-particularly challenging. Existing FE solutions often neglect
potential system-wide solutions and focus on the classifier, overlooking the
substantial hardware cost of feature extraction and Analog-to-Digital
Converters (ADCs)-both major contributors to area and power consumption. In
this work, we present a holistic mixed-signal feature-to-classifier co-design
framework for flexible smart wearable systems. To the best of our knowledge, we
design the first analog feature extractors in FE, significantly reducing
feature extraction cost. We further propose an hardware-aware NAS-inspired
feature selection strategy within ML training, enabling efficient,
application-specific designs. Our evaluation on healthcare benchmarks shows our
approach delivers highly accurate, ultra-area-efficient flexible systems-ideal
for disposable, low-power wearable monitoring.

Abstract: The use of communication satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO) is foreseen
to provide quasi-global broadband Internet connectivity in the coming
networking ecosystems. Multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO)
digital signal processing techniques, such as precoding, emerge as appealing
technological enablers in the forward link of multi-beam satellite systems
operating in full frequency reuse (FFR). However, the orbit dynamics of MEO
satellites pose additional challenges that must be carefully evaluated and
addressed. This work presents the design of an in-lab testbed based on
software-defined radio (SDR) platforms and the corresponding adaptations
required for efficient precoding in a MEO scenario. The setup incorporates a
precise orbit model and the radiation pattern of a custom-designed direct
radiating array (DRA). We analyze the main impairments affecting precoding
performance, including Doppler shifts and payload phase noise, and propose a
synchronization loop to mitigate these effects. Preliminary experimental
results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Printed electronics offer a promising alternative for applications beyond
silicon-based systems, requiring properties like flexibility, stretchability,
conformality, and ultra-low fabrication costs. Despite the large feature sizes
in printed electronics, printed neural networks have attracted attention for
meeting target application requirements, though realizing complex circuits

and area efficiency in printed neural networks, covering the entire
processing-near-sensor system design and co-optimization from the
analog-to-digital interface-a major area and power bottleneck-to the digital
classifier. We propose an automated framework for designing printed Ternary
Neural Networks with arbitrary input precision, utilizing multi-objective
optimization and holistic approximation. Our circuits outperform existing
approximate printed neural networks by 17x in area and 59x in power on average,
being the first to enable printed-battery-powered operation with under 5%
accuracy loss while accounting for analog-to-digital interfacing costs.

Abstract: Recently, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), a biological material produced by
non-pathogenic bacteria that possesses excellent material properties for
various medical applications, has received increased interest as a carrier
system for drug delivery. However, the vast majority of existing studies on
drug release from BNC are feasibility studies with modeling and design aspects
remaining largely unexplored. To narrow this research gap, this paper proposes
a novel model for the drug release from BNC. Specifically, the drug delivery
system considered in this paper consists of a BNC fleece coated with a polymer.
The polymer coating is used as an additional diffusion barrier, enabling the
controlled release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The proposed
physics-based model reflects the geometry of the BNC and incorporates the
impact of the polymer coating on the drug release. Hence, it can be useful for
designing BNC-based drug delivery systems in the future. The accuracy of the
model is validated with experimental data obtained in wet lab experiments.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized problem that minimizes or maximizes a
multi-order complex quadratic form with constant-modulus constraints on all
elements of its optimization variable. Such a mathematical problem is commonly
encountered in various applications of signal processing. We term it as the
constant-modulus multi-order complex quadratic programming (CMCQP) in this
paper. In general, the CMCQP is non-convex and difficult to solve. Its
objective function typically relates to metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio,
Cram\'er-Rao bound, integrated sidelobe level, etc., and constraints normally
correspond to requirements on similarity to desired aspects,
peak-to-average-power ratio, or constant-modulus property in practical
scenarios. In order to find efficient solutions to the CMCQP, we first
reformulate it into an unconstrained optimization problem with respect to phase
values of the studied variable only. Then, we devise a steepest descent/ascent
method with fast determinations on its optimal step sizes. Specifically, we
convert the step-size searching problem into a polynomial form that leads to
closed-form solutions of high accuracy, wherein the third-order Taylor
expansion of the search function is conducted. Our major contributions also lie
in investigating the effect of the order and specific form of matrices embedded
in the CMCQP, for which two representative cases are identified. Examples of
related applications associated with the two cases are also provided for
completeness. The proposed methods are summarized into algorithms, whose
convergence speeds are verified to be fast by comprehensive simulations and
comparisons to existing methods. The accuracy of our proposed fast step-size
determination is also evaluated.

Abstract: Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are an attractive technology for short-reach
intensity modulation and direct detection communication systems. However, their
complex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based
systems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of
DML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on
experimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and
equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF)
power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization
scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different
benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The
results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better
performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances
while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a
smaller signal bandwidth.

Conclusion: 该标签化PLA框架为免细胎大规模MIMO网络提供了一种高效、可靠的多用户同时认证方案，能够有效防范主动冒充攻击。

Abstract: In this paper, we exploit the cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) architecture to design a physical-layer
authentication (PLA) framework that can simultaneously authenticate multiple
distributed users across the coverage area. Our proposed scheme remains
effective even in the presence of active adversaries attempting impersonation
attacks to disrupt the authentication process. Specifically, we introduce a
tag-based PLA CFmMIMO system, wherein the access points (APs) first estimate
their channels with the legitimate users during an uplink training phase.
Subsequently, a unique secret key is generated and securely shared between each
user and the APs. We then formulate a hypothesis testing problem and derive a
closed-form expression for the probability of detection for each user in the
network. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
demonstrating that it maintains a high detection probability even as the number
of users in the system increases.

TL;DR: Error

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: According to some standards for satellite communications, the transmitted
stream is divided into transmission units with variable length, for which
detecting the termination is particularly relevant. This is the case of space
TeleCommands (TCs), where coded data are usually preceded by a start sequence,
and optionally followed by a tail sequence, forming the Communication Link
Transmission Unit (CLTU). Regarding the choice of schemes for error correction,
the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems recommendations for TC
synchronization and coding suggests to use, among others, two Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) codes: one (relatively) long and one short. Adopting the
long LDPC code eliminates the need for a tail sequence, as the LDPC decoder
always fails when overrunning the end of the CLTU, thus causing the decoding
and detection process to stop. This, however, is not true when the short LDPC
code is adopted, since its decoding might converge on a codeword even when the
decoder input is not a noisy codeword. This makes it necessary to use a tail
sequence that causes the decoder to fail regardless of its input. In this
paper, we study the features required for such a sequence and propose some
methods for its design. Our numerical results, obtained considering various
detection approaches for the tail sequence, show that the overall TC rejection
probability improves significantly when the proposed tail sequence is employed.
Our simulations also show that, for moderate values of the Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR), with a properly designed tail sequence it is possible to obtain
the same performance in terms of TC rejection probability using decoder-based
detection and likelihood ratio test-based detection, with the former approach
being less complex than the latter.

Motivation: 信息论中量化噪声信道信息损失的基本问题，传统偏序方法评估困难，需要扩展Geng等人关于BISO信道在更强大偏序下的极值性结果到Renyi互信息框架

Method: 基于Renyi互信息建立偏序关系，引入α-Lorenz曲线作为分析工具，推广所需数学工具，对二进制输入对称输出(BISO)信道进行理论分析

Result: 证明了在相同容量的BISO信道中，二进制对称信道(BSC)和二进制擦除信道(BEC)在广义Renyi容量偏序下具有极值性

Conclusion: 成功将BSC和BEC的极值性结果从传统容量偏序扩展到Renyi互信息框架，为信息论中的信道比较提供了新的理论工具和分析方法

Abstract: A fundamental question in information theory is to quantify the loss of
information under a noisy channel. Partial orders are typical tools to that
end, however, they are often also challenging to evaluate. For the special
class of binary input symmetric output (BISO) channels, Geng et al. showed that
among channels with the same capacity, the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and
binary erasure channel (BEC) are extremal with respect to the more capable
order. Here we extend on this result by considering partial orders based on
Renyi mutual information. We establish the extremality of the BSC and BEC in
this setting with respect to the generalized Renyi capacity. In the process, we
also generalize the needed tools and introduce $\alpha$-Lorenz curves.

Abstract: This paper explores multiuser multiple antenna systems as a means to enhance
the spectral efficiency of aeronautical communications systems. To this end,
the outage regime for a multiuser multiple antenna system is studied within a
realistic geometry-based stochastic air-ground (AG) channel model. In this
application, users (aircraft) transmit air traffic management data to the
ground station at a predefined target rate. Due to the nature of the AG
propagation, we argue that the relevant performance metric in this context is
the information outage probability. We consider the outage probability under
three decoding approaches. The first is based on successive interference
cancellation (SIC). The second extends the first approach by considering joint
group decoding. The third is a version of the second that limits the size of
the jointly decoded user groups in order to lower the decoding complexity. The
results show that joint group decoding, even in groups of only two, can
significantly increase the spectral efficiency in the AG channel by allowing a
large number of aircraft to transmit over a non-orthogonal channel with very
low outage probabilities.
