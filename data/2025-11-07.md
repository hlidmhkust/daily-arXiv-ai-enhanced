### [1] [Reconstruction-free segmentation from undersampled k-space using transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03762)
*Yundi Zhang,Nil Stolt-Ansó,Jiazhen Pan,Wenqi Huang,Kerstin Hammernik,Daniel Rueckert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种直接从稀疏k空间测量生成分割的方法，无需中间图像重建步骤，可在高加速因子下获得比基于图像的分割基线更好的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高加速因子限制了MRI图像重建，当将分割模型作为后续独立过程处理时，这种限制会延伸到分割模型。

Method: 采用transformer架构将全局k空间信息编码为潜在特征，生成的潜在向量在解码过程中调节查询坐标以生成分割类别概率。

Result: 该模型能够在高加速因子下产生比基于图像的分割基线更好的分割结果。

Conclusion: 直接从欠采样k空间样本进行心脏分割避免了中间图像重建步骤的需求，这为在比依赖图像输入的方法更高的加速因子下评估心肌结构和功能提供了可能。

Abstract: Motivation: High acceleration factors place a limit on MRI image
reconstruction. This limit is extended to segmentation models when treating
these as subsequent independent processes.
  Goal: Our goal is to produce segmentations directly from sparse k-space
measurements without the need for intermediate image reconstruction.
  Approach: We employ a transformer architecture to encode global k-space
information into latent features. The produced latent vectors condition queried
coordinates during decoding to generate segmentation class probabilities.
  Results: The model is able to produce better segmentations across high
acceleration factors than image-based segmentation baselines.
  Impact: Cardiac segmentation directly from undersampled k-space samples
circumvents the need for an intermediate image reconstruction step. This allows
the potential to assess myocardial structure and function on higher
acceleration factors than methods that rely on images as input.

### [2] [Computed Tomography (CT)-derived Cardiovascular Flow Estimation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks Improves with Sinogram-based Training: A Simulation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03876)
*Jinyuxuan Guo,Gurnoor Singh Khurana,Alejandro Gonzalo Grande,Juan C. del Alamo,Francisco Contijoch*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究提出SinoFlow框架，直接使用CT原始数据（sinogram）估计血流速度，相比基于重建图像的PINN方法显著提高了血流估计精度，避免了滤波反投影引入的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT广泛用于心血管评估，但直接从对比剂演化电影估计血流速度的方法尚未开发。现有方法基于重建图像，会受到滤波反投影误差的影响。

Method: 在理想化2D血管分叉中生成脉动流场，模拟不同CT扫描参数（机架转速、管电流、脉冲模式），比较基于重建图像的PINN方法（ImageFlow）与直接使用sinogram数据的SinoFlow方法。

Result: SinoFlow显著提高了血流估计性能，在所有测试的机架转速下都表现稳健，产生更低的均方误差和速度误差。SinoFlow兼容脉冲模式成像，在更短脉冲宽度下保持更高精度。

Conclusion: SinoFlow为基于CT的血流估计提供了更有前景的方法，为PINN在CT图像中的应用提供了解决方案，合理的采集参数可获得准确的血流估计。

Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a
critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography
(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate
cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow
velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved
framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel
bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with
varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.
We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed
images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by
avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was
robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower
mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow
was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with
shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based
flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood
flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT
images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable
acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.

### [3] [Shape Deformation Networks for Automated Aortic Valve Finite Element Meshing from 3D CT Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03890)
*Linchen Qian,Jiasong Chen,Ruonan Gong,Wei Sun,Minliang Liu,Liang Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度神经网络的模板拟合流程，从3D CT图像生成结构化四边形网格来表示主动脉瓣几何形状，确保跨患者的一致性和高质量网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从3D CT图像准确建模主动脉瓣几何形状对于生物力学分析和患者特异性模拟至关重要，但传统方法生成的三角网格存在拓扑不规则、元素形状差和患者间对应关系不一致的问题。

Method: 通过为所有患者使用共同的四边形网格模板重新网格化主动脉瓣，确保统一的网格拓扑结构。采用仅包含几何重建项和平滑度正则化项的损失函数来简化深度学习目标。

Result: 实验表明该方法生成的高质量主动脉瓣表面网格具有改进的平滑度和形状质量，相比传统方法需要更少的显式正则化项。

Conclusion: 使用结构化四边形网格作为模板进行神经网络训练不仅确保网格对应关系和质量，还简化了训练过程，提高了主动脉瓣建模的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is
essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess
valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to
generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across
different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with
irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and
inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline
with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)
meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing
aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a
uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element
correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the
learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function
with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness
regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and
element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and
shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to
the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad
meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh
correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus
enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.

### [4] [DeepFixel: Crossing white matter fiber identification through spherical convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03893)
*Adam M. Saunders,Lucas W. Remedios,Elyssa M. McMaster,Jongyeon Yoon,Gaurav Rudravaram,Adam Sadriddinov,Praitayini Kanakaraj,Bennett A. Landman,Adam W. Anderson*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DeepFixel是一种球面卷积神经网络，用于高效分离扩散加权MRI中的纤维方向分布函数，解决了传统非线性优化的计算不可行性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散加权MRI中交叉白质纤维的存在使分析复杂化，传统非线性优化方法计算成本过高（约1.01×10^6 ms/体素），无法在整个图像上应用。

Method: 使用球面卷积神经网络近似非线性优化，采用比截断球谐表示更高角分辨率的球面网格建模纤维概率分布。

Result: DeepFixel计算效率显著提升（0.32 ms/体素），角相关系数中位数为0.973（四分位距0.004），在较小角度分离和较小体积分数下表现优于基于fixel的分离算法。

Conclusion: DeepFixel成功实现了纤维ODF的高效分离，在计算效率和分离能力方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows for reconstruction of
models for structural connectivity in the brain, such as fiber orientation
distribution functions (ODFs) that describe the distribution, direction, and
volume of white matter fiber bundles in a voxel. Crossing white matter fibers
in voxels complicate analysis and can lead to errors in downstream tasks like
tractography. We introduce one option for separating fiber ODFs by performing a
nonlinear optimization to fit ODFs to the given data and penalizing terms that
are not symmetric about the axis of the fiber. However, this optimization is
non-convex and computationally infeasible across an entire image (approximately
1.01 x 106 ms per voxel). We introduce DeepFixel, a spherical convolutional
neural network approximation for this nonlinear optimization. We model the
probability distribution of fibers as a spherical mesh with higher angular
resolution than a truncated spherical harmonic representation. To validate
DeepFixel, we compare to the nonlinear optimization and a fixel-based
separation algorithm of two-fiber and three-fiber ODFs. The median angular
correlation coefficient is 1 (interquartile range of 0.00) using the nonlinear
optimization algorithm, 0.988 (0.317) using a fiber bundle elements or
"fixel"-based separation algorithm, and 0.973 (0.004) using DeepFixel.
DeepFixel is more computationally efficient than the non-convex optimization
(0.32 ms per voxel). DeepFixel's spherical mesh representation is successful at
disentangling at smaller angular separations and smaller volume fractions than
the fixel-based separation algorithm.

### [5] [$μ$NeuFMT: Optical-Property-Adaptive Fluorescence Molecular Tomography via Implicit Neural Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04510)
*Shihan Zhao,Jianru Zhang,Yanan Wu,Linlin Li,Siyuan Shen,Xingjun Zhu,Guoyan Zheng,Jiahua Jiang,Wuwei Ren*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出μNeuFMT，一种自监督的荧光分子断层扫描重建框架，通过联合优化荧光分布和光学特性，无需组织光学特性的精确先验知识或预训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光分子断层扫描(FMT)重建面临固有的不适定性和对不准确或未知组织光学特性的依赖问题，而现有深度学习方法由于监督性质限制了泛化能力。

Method: 将隐式神经场景表示与光子传播的显式物理建模相结合，在重建过程中联合优化荧光分布和光学特性(μ)。

Result: μNeuFMT即使在初始值严重错误(0.5×到2×真实值)的情况下也能稳健恢复准确的荧光团分布和光学系数，在数值、仿体和体内验证中优于传统和监督深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 为稳健准确的FMT重建建立了新范式，为复杂临床相关场景中更可靠的分子成像铺平了道路。

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for
non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction
remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on
inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning
methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a
self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit
neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon
propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence
distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction,
eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or
pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly
recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with
severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth).
Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT
outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse
heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and
accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging
in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.

### [6] [Environment Division Multiple Access (EDMA): A Feasibility Study via Pinching Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03820)
*Zhiguo Ding,Robert Schober,H. V. Poor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为环境分割多址(EDMA)的新多址技术，利用无线传播环境的动态特性，通过捏合天线智能重构多用户传播环境，在不需复杂信号处理的情况下提高目标接收器信号强度并抑制多址干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多址技术需要复杂的信号处理如预编码、波束成形或多用户检测，EDMA旨在通过智能重构传播环境来避免这些复杂性，同时提高性能。

Method: 使用捏合天线重新配置视距链路，通过将捏合天线放置在特定位置来有意阻断干扰链路。开发了两种低复杂度算法分别用于上行和下行传输，并研究了捏合天线位置优化。

Result: 推导了EDMA相比传统多址的遍历和速率增益闭式表达式，仿真结果显示所提算法在相比穷举搜索时具有最优性。

Conclusion: EDMA在支持多用户通信方面具有显著潜力，通过捏合天线智能重构传播环境可以显著提高系统性能。

Abstract: This paper exploits the dynamic features of wireless propagation environments
as the basis for a new multiple access technique, termed environment division
multiple access (EDMA). In particular, with the proposed
pinching-antenna-assisted EDMA, the multi-user propagation environment is
intelligently reconfigured to improve signal strength at intended receivers and
simultaneously suppress multiple-access interference, without requiring complex
signal processing, e.g., precoding, beamforming, or multi-user detection. The
key to creating a favorable propagation environment is to utilize the
capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure line-of-sight (LoS) links, e.g.,
pinching antennas are placed at specific locations, such that interference
links are blocked on purpose. Based on a straightforward choice of
pinching-antenna locations, the ergodic sum-rate gain of EDMA over conventional
multiple access and the probability that EDMA achieves a larger instantaneous
sum rate than the considered benchmarking scheme are derived in closed form.
The obtained analytical results demonstrate the significant potential of EDMA
for supporting multi-user communications. Furthermore, pinching antenna
location optimization is also investigated, since the locations of pinching
antennas are critical for reconfiguring LoS links and large-scale path losses.
Two low-complexity algorithms are developed for uplink and downlink
transmission, respectively, and simulation results are provided to show their
optimality in comparison to exhaustive searches.

### [7] [Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849)
*Phuc Nguyen,Josiah Couch,Rahul Bansal,Alexandra Morgan,Chris Tam,Miao Li,Rima Arnaout,Ramy Arnaout*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文比较了Leinster-Cobbold-Reeve (LCR)相似性敏感熵和Vendi评分(VS)两种方法，通过概念、分析和实验分析发现两者可以相差数个数量级并捕获互补信息，VS在某些情况下为LCR提供上界，建议根据具体应用场景选择合适方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化系统时传统熵度量仅捕获元素频率信息，而LCR和VS方法还能捕获元素间相似性和差异性的丰富信息，但两者比较和选择标准尚不明确。

Method: 使用53个机器学习数据集，通过概念分析、数学证明和实验验证比较LCR和VS方法，引入"半距离"概念参数化相似性缩放依赖。

Result: LCR和VS可以相差数个数量级，捕获互补信息；VS为LCR提供上界；两种方法都依赖于相似性缩放方式；VS仅在特定解释下更优。

Conclusion: 当将元素解释为更基本"ur-elements"的线性组合或系统具有量子力学特征时VS更优；在更广泛情况下，为捕获相似性编码的丰富信息，LCR更受青睐；在某些半距离下两种方法可以互补。

Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon
entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information
encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,
and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information
encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding
similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was
introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,
and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,
analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show
that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary
information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both
LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of
``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an
upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and
conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is
preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more
fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a
quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks
simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;
nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each
other.

### [8] [Efficient and rate-optimal list-decoding in the presence of minimal feedback: Weldon and Slepian-Wolf in sheep's clothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04088)
*Pranav Joshi,Daniel McMorrow,Yihan Zhang,Amitalok J. Budkuley,Sidharth Jaggi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Given a channel with length-$n$ inputs and outputs over the alphabet
$\{0,1,\ldots,q-1\}$, and of which a fraction $\varrho \in (0,1-1/q)$ of
symbols can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary, a fundamental problem is
that of communicating at rates close to the information-theoretically optimal
values, while ensuring the receiver can infer that the transmitter's message is
from a ``small" set. While the existence of such codes is known, and
constructions with computationally tractable encoding/decoding procedures are
known for large $q$, we provide the first schemes that attain this performance
for any $q \geq 2$, as long as low-rate feedback (asymptotically negligible
relative to the number of transmissions) from the receiver to the transmitter
is available. For any sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$ and $\varrho \in
(1-1/q-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ our minimal feedback scheme has the
following parameters: Rate $1-H_q(\varrho) - \varepsilon$ (i.e.,
$\varepsilon$-close to information-theoretically optimal -- here $H_q(\varrho)$
is the $q$-ary entropy function), list-size
$\exp(\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3/2}\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$, computational
complexity of encoding/decoding
$n^{\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(1/\varepsilon))}$, storage complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n^{\eta+1}\log n)$ for a code design parameter $\eta>1$ that
trades off storage complexity with the probability of error. The error
probability is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\eta})$, and the (vanishing) feedback rate is
$\mathcal{O}(1/ \log n)$.

### [9] [List Decoding of Folded Reed-Solomon Codes Over Galois Ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04135)
*Chen Yuan,Ruiqi Zhu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Guruswami-Sudan列表解码方法到伽罗瓦环上的Reed-Solomon码，证明了速率为r的RS码可以在1-√r半径内列表解码，并研究了折叠RS码在伽罗瓦环上的列表解码，使其达到Singleton界，最后将列表大小改进到O(1/ε²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于零知识证明系统的发展需求，需要研究伽罗瓦环上码的邻近间隙问题。有限域上的RS码列表解码已有较好结果，但伽罗瓦环上的研究较少，这阻碍了基于环的算术电路的零知识证明系统发展。

Method: 首先将Guruswami-Sudan列表解码过程扩展到伽罗瓦环上的Reed-Solomon码，然后研究伽罗瓦环上折叠Reed-Solomon码的列表解码，最后通过扩展Shashank Srivastava(2025)的工作改进列表大小。

Result: 证明了伽罗瓦环上速率为r的RS码可以在1-√r半径内列表解码；折叠RS码的列表解码半径可以达到Singleton界；列表大小改进到O(1/ε²)。

Conclusion: 成功将列表解码技术扩展到伽罗瓦环上的RS码和折叠RS码，为基于环的零知识证明系统提供了理论基础，填补了伽罗瓦环上码列表解码的研究空白。

Abstract: List decoding of codes can be seen as the generalization of unique decoding
of codes While list decoding over finite fields has been extensively studied,
extending these results to more general algebraic structures such as Galois
rings remains an important challenge. Due to recent progress in zero knowledge
systems, there is a growing demand to investigate the proximity gap of codes
over Galois rings in Yizhou Yao and coauthors(2025), Alexander Golovne and
coauthors(2023), Yuanju Wei and coauthors(2025). The proximity gap is closely
related to the decoding capability of codes. It was shown in Eli Ben-Sasson and
coauthors(2020) that the proximity gap for RS codes over finite field can be
improved to $1-\sqrt{r}$ if one consider list decoding instead of unique
decoding. However, we know very little about RS codes over Galois ring which
might hinder the development of zero knowledge proof system for ring-based
arithmetic circuit. In this work, we first extend the list decoding procedure
of Guruswami and Sudan to Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings, which shows
that RS codes with rate $r$ can be list decoded up to radius $1-\sqrt{r}$.
Then, we investigate the list decoding of folded Reed-Solomon codes over Galois
rings. We show that the list decoding radius of folded Reed-Solomon codes can
reach the Singlton bound as its counterpart over finite field. Finally, we
improve the list size of our folded Reed-Solomon code to
$O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ by extending recent work in Shashank
Srivastava(2025) to Galois Rings.

### [10] [Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: From Communication to Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04471)
*Ali Bemani,Nassar Ksairi,Marios Kountouris*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: AFDM波形在集成感知与通信系统中具有优势，能通过低复杂度自干扰消除和模拟去啁啾降低采样率，在双静态感知中支持亚奈奎斯特采样，并利用离散仿射傅里叶变换的资源分配灵活性减轻多雷达环境干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集成感知与通信系统中的两个关键挑战：(1)在大带宽下维持可接受的接收器复杂度和能耗，(2)在多雷达环境中减轻干扰。

Method: 在单静态感知中使用AFDM兼容的低复杂度自干扰消除方案和模拟去啁啾降低采样率；在双静态感知中利用AFDM支持亚奈奎斯特采样；通过离散仿射傅里叶变换的资源分配灵活性管理干扰。

Result: AFDM能够有效降低接收器复杂度和能耗，支持高延迟/距离分辨率，并在多雷达环境中减轻干扰。

Conclusion: AFDM波形在集成感知与通信系统中展现出显著优势，特别是在降低复杂度和能耗、支持高分辨率感知以及干扰管理方面。

Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been proposed as an
effective waveform for achieving the full diversity of doubly-dispersive
(delay-Doppler) channels. While this property is closely related to range and
velocity estimation in sensing, this article focuses on other AFDM features
that are particularly relevant for addressing two challenges in integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems: (1) maintaining receiver complexity
and energy consumption at acceptable levels while supporting the large
bandwidths required for high delay/range resolution, and (2) mitigating
interference in multiradar environments. In monostatic sensing, where direct
transmitter-receiver leakage is a major impairment, we show that AFDM-based
ISAC receivers can address the first challenge through their compatibility with
low-complexity self-interference cancellation (SIC) schemes and reduced
sampling rates via analog dechirping. In bistatic sensing, where such analog
solutions may not be feasible, we demonstrate that AFDM supports sub-Nyquist
sampling without requiring hardware modifications while preserving delay
resolution. Finally, we show that the second challenge can be addressed by
leveraging the resource-assignment flexibility of the discrete affine Fourier
transform (DAFT) underlying the AFDM waveform.

### [11] [Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630)
*Stavros Mitrolaris,Subhankar Banerjee,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个时间分槽的作业分配系统，包含中央服务器、N个用户和状态按马尔可夫链变化的机器。服务器通过采样机器状态信息来调度作业，目标是最大化单位时间完成的作业数，引入了作业完成年龄新指标，并提出了两种策略来最小化该指标和采样成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在作业分配系统中，当机器状态变化遵循马尔可夫过程时，如何有效调度作业以最大化系统吞吐量是一个重要问题。传统方法可能无法充分考虑到机器状态动态变化对作业完成效率的影响，因此需要开发新的性能指标和调度策略。

Method: 提出了两种策略：1）基于机器状态采样的调度策略，当检测到机器空闲时从用户作业队列中选择作业分配；2）引入了作业完成年龄作为新性能指标，用于衡量作业完成效率；3）分析了两种策略下作业队列稳定性的充分条件。

Result: 通过数值评估验证了所提策略的性能，证明了在满足特定条件下作业队列能够保持稳定。新引入的作业完成年龄指标能够有效反映系统吞吐量性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于机器状态采样的调度策略和作业完成年龄指标，能够有效提升作业分配系统的性能，同时保证系统稳定性，为动态环境下的作业调度问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N
users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence
called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server
according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a
dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that
job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job
assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free
state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain.
Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies
that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to
the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of
jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age
of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost,
we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of
these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will
remain stable.

### [12] [Correlation and Temporal Consistency Analysis of Mono-static and Bi-static ISAC Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03837)
*Saúl Fenollosa,Narcis Cardona,Wenfei Yang,Jian Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文通过79GHz FMCW信道测量，揭示了单静态和双静态ISAC信道在动态城市微小区环境中的相关性和演化特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信道模型缺乏对ISAC特定动态的全面表征，特别是单静态（共置Tx/Rx）和双静态（分离Tx/Rx）感知配置之间的关系。

Method: 使用79GHz FMCW信道测量仪在动态城市微小区环境中进行实证测量，验证了七个真实场景中移动目标/收发器的数据。

Result: 发现单静态和双静态信道由于传播几何差异而呈现持续低瞬时相关性，但两者共享统一的时间一致性，在环境运动学下可预测地演化。

Conclusion: 这些见解为鲁棒的ISAC系统设计和未来标准化提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is critical for efficient
spectrum and hardware utilization in future wireless networks like 6G. However,
existing channel models lack comprehensive characterization of ISAC-specific
dynamics, particularly the relationship between mono-static (co-located Tx/Rx)
and bi-static (separated Tx/Rx) sensing configurations. Empirical measurements
in dynamic urban microcell (UMi) environments using a 79-GHz FMCW channel
sounder help bridge this gap. Two key findings are demonstrated: (1)
mono-static and bi-static channels exhibit consistently low instantaneous
correlation due to divergent propagation geometries; (2) despite low
instantaneous correlation, both channels share unified temporal consistency,
evolving predictably under environmental kinematics. These insights, validated
across seven real-world scenarios with moving targets/transceivers, inform
robust ISAC system design and future standardization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示学习的智能反射面相位信息压缩系统，通过混合提示技术和可变速率方法，在单一模型中实现自适应压缩，显著降低重构误差并保持低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能反射面在无线网络中面临控制链路带宽受限导致的相位信息传输开销过大问题，现有深度学习方法存在解码器复杂度高、对动态信道适应性差、压缩比固定等限制。

Result: 相比传统自编码器基线显著降低归一化均方误差(NMSE)，在各种信道条件下保持鲁棒性，单一模型支持可变压缩比。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代无线网络中实时IRS控制提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have become a vital technology for
improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of forthcoming wireless networks.
Nevertheless, practical implementation is obstructed by the excessive overhead
associated with the frequent transmission of phase shift information (PSI) over
bandwidth-constrained control lines. Current deep learning-based compression
methods mitigate this problem but are constrained by elevated decoder
complexity, inadequate flexibility to dynamic channels, and static compression
ratios. This research presents a prompt-conditioned PSI compression system that
integrates prompt learning inspired by large models into the PSI compression
process to address these difficulties. A hybrid prompt technique that
integrates soft prompt concatenation with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
facilitates adaptive encoding across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs),
fading kinds, and compression ratios. Furthermore, a variable rate technique
incorporates the compression ratio into the prompt embeddings through latent
masking, enabling a singular model to adeptly balance reconstruction accuracy.
Additionally, a lightweight depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) decoder
facilitates precise feature reconstruction with minimal complexity.
Comprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed framework significantly
reduces NMSE compared to traditional autoencoder baselines, while ensuring
robustness across various channel circumstances and accommodating variable
compression ratios within a single model. These findings underscore the
framework's promise as a scalable and efficient solution for real-time IRS
control in next-generation wireless networks.

Conclusion: min-SCUSUM方法为复杂模型的高维数据快速变化检测提供了可行的替代方案，无需显式分布假设。

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to multi-stream quickest change detection
and fault isolation for unnormalized and score-based statistical models.
Traditional optimal algorithms in the quickest change detection literature
require explicit pre-change and post-change distributions to calculate the
likelihood ratio of the observations, which can be computationally expensive
for higher-dimensional data and sometimes even infeasible for complex machine
learning models. To address these challenges, we propose the min-SCUSUM method,
a Hyvarinen score-based algorithm that computes the difference of score
functions in place of log-likelihood ratios. We provide a delay and false alarm
analysis of the proposed algorithm, showing that its asymptotic performance
depends on the Fisher divergence between the pre- and post-change
distributions. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound on the probability of
fault misidentification in distinguishing the affected stream from the
unaffected ones.

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-assisted integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) systems have been extensively studied to achieve
ubiquitous connectivity. However, the severe signal attenuation and limited
transmit power at LEO satellites can degrade ISAC performance. To address this
issue, this paper investigated movable antenna (MA)-assisted LEO ISAC systems.
We derive the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and
the sensing squared position error bound (SPEB) for evaluating the ISAC
performance. Then, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the MA
positions to minimize the SPEB under the SINR constraints, total transmit power
constraint, and several inherent physical constraints of the MA array. We first
simplify the complex problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we
present a novel alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to decouple the
original problem into two subproblems, consequently convexified and solved.
Simulations demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm. Better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and
at least 25% gain in sensing performance are achieved, compared to the
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS辅助系统研究大多假设基站、RIS和用户位置已知，但实际部署前通常只知道用户密度分布和障碍物配置。因此需要一种能在用户位置随机情况下优化RIS部署的方法。

Method: 提出递归从粗到精的方法：基于障碍物配置构建候选位置集，通过多次用户分布实例评估，在每阶段识别最优区域并递归细化搜索，最终确定RIS最佳部署区域。

Result: 数值结果验证了所提方法的有效性，能够找到优化系统最小期望信干噪比的RIS部署位置。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际RIS部署提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在用户位置不确定的情况下优化系统性能。

Abstract: It is well established that the performance of reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted systems critically depends on the optimal placement of
the RIS. Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or
simultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the
beamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location
of the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only
the spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to
be known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex
problem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user
randomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after
deployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine
methodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement
based on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple
instantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined
within the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final
optimal region for RIS deployment. Numerical results are presented to
corroborate our findings.

Abstract: The proliferation of sixth-generation (6G) networks and the massive Internet
of Things (IoT) demand wireless communication technologies that are
ultra-low-power, secure, and covert. Noise-based communication has emerged as a
transformative paradigm that meets these demands by encoding information
directly into the statistical properties of noise, rather than using
traditional deterministic carriers. This survey provides a comprehensive
synthesis of this field, systematically exploring its fundamental principles
and key methodologies, including thermal noise modulation (TherMod), noise
modulation (NoiseMod) and its variants, and the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise
(KLJN) secure key exchange. We address critical practical challenges such as
channel estimation and hardware implementation, and highlight emerging
applications in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Our analysis confirms that
noise-based systems offer unparalleled advantages in energy efficiency and
covertness, and we conclude by outlining future research directions to realize
their potential for enabling the next generation of autonomous and secure
wireless networks.

Conclusion: AFDM参数设计方法能有效缓解强目标AF凹陷对弱目标检测的不利影响，数值结果验证了理论分析和设计方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ambiguity function (AF) of the emerging affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform for Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) signaling under a pulse shaping regime. Specifically, we
first derive the closed-form expression of the average squared discrete period
AF (DPAF) for AFDM waveform without pulse shaping, revealing that the AF
depends on the parameter $c_1$ and the kurtosis of random communication data,
while being independent of the parameter $c_2$. As a step further, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis on the AFs of various waveforms, including AFDM,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp-division
multiplexing (OCDM). Our results indicate that all three waveforms exhibit the
same number of regular depressions in the sidelobes of their AFs, which incurs
performance loss for detecting and estimating weak targets. However, the AFDM
waveform can flexibly control the positions of depressions by adjusting the
parameter $c_1$, which motivates a novel design approach of the AFDM parameters
to mitigate the adverse impact of depressions of the strong target on the weak
target. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of the average squared DPAF for
pulse-shaped random AFDM waveform is derived, which demonstrates that the pulse
shaping filter generates the shaped mainlobe along the delay axis and the rapid
roll-off sidelobes along the Doppler axis. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed design methodology for
the AFDM modulation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的张量特征提取方法BTTDA，通过灵活的块项张量分解来增强脑电信号分类性能，在ERP解码中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量方法如Tucker和PARAFAC分解在捕捉脑电数据复杂性方面缺乏灵活性，需要更有效的特征提取方法来提高脑机接口分类准确率。

Method: 提出块项张量判别分析(BTTDA)，扩展高阶判别分析(HODA)，结合可解释前向模型和紧缩方案迭代提取判别块项，改进分类特征表示。

Result: 在MOABB基准测试中，BTTDA和PARAFACDA在ERP解码上显著优于传统HODA方法，达到91.25%的ROC-AUC；在运动想象任务中，BTTDA(64.52%)也显著优于HODA(61.00%)。

Conclusion: BTTDA的块项结构实现了可解释且高效的降维，不损失判别能力，为BCI和神经影像应用提供了有前景的适应性特征提取方法。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain
and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record
neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are
essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including
event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current
tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack
the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study
introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel
tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance
classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality
reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a
novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme
to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature
representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant
PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and
MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.
Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the
traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art
performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and
PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%
> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more
efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.
This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI
and broader neuroimaging applications.

Conclusion: 自监督跨模态对齐结合显式退化建模和自适应融合是实现可部署多模态动作识别的关键。

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) with multi-modal inputs (RGB-D, skeleton,
point cloud) can achieve high accuracy but typically relies on large labeled
datasets and degrades sharply when sensors fail or are noisy. We present Robust
Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning (RCMCL), a self-supervised framework that
learns modality-invariant representations and remains reliable under modality
dropout and corruption. RCMCL jointly optimizes (i) a cross-modal contrastive
objective that aligns heterogeneous streams, (ii) an intra-modal
self-distillation objective that improves view-invariance and reduces
redundancy, and (iii) a degradation simulation objective that explicitly trains
models to recover from masked or corrupted inputs. At inference, an Adaptive
Modality Gating (AMG) network assigns data-driven reliability weights to each
modality for robust fusion. On NTU RGB+D 120 (CS/CV) and UWA3D-II, RCMCL
attains state-of-the-art accuracy in standard settings and exhibits markedly
better robustness: under severe dual-modality dropout it shows only an 11.5%
degradation, significantly outperforming strong supervised fusion baselines.
These results indicate that self-supervised cross-modal alignment, coupled with
explicit degradation modeling and adaptive fusion, is key to deployable
multi-modal HAR.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the potential of high-resolution forest mapping
using L-band interferometric time series datasets and deep learning modeling.
Our SAR data are represented by a time series of nine ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dual-pol
SAR images acquired at near-zero spatial baseline over a study site in
Asturias, Northern Spain. Reference data are collected using airborne laser
scanning. We examine the performance of several candidate deep learning models
from UNet-family with various combinations of input polarimetric and
interferometric features. In addition to basic Vanilla UNet, attention
reinforced UNet model with squeeze-excitation blocks (SeU-Net) and advanced
UNet model with nested structure and skip pathways are used. Studied features
include dual pol interferometric observables additionally incorporating
model-based derived measures. Results show that adding model-based inverted
InSAR features or InSAR coherence layers improves retrieval accuracy compared
to using backscatter intensity only. Use of attention mechanisms and nested
connection fusion provides better predictions than using Vanilla UNet or
traditional machine learning methods. Forest height retrieval accuracies range
between 3.1-3.8 m (R2 = 0.45--0.55) at 20 m resolution when only intensity data
are used, and improve to less than 2.8 m when both intensity and
interferometric coherence features are included. At 40 m and 60 m resolution,
retrieval performance further improves, primarily due to higher SNR in both the
intensity and interferometric layers. When using intensity at 60 m resolution,
best achieved RMSE is 2.2 m, while when using all suitable input features the
achieved error is 1.95 m. We recommend this hybrid approach for L-band SAR
retrievals also suitable for NISAR and future ROSE-L missions.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have been recognized as a promising
technology to enhance both communication and sensing performance in integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for future 6G networks. However,
existing RIS optimization methods for improving ISAC performance are mainly
based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or iterative algorithms. The former
suffers from high computational complexity and limited scalability, especially
when the number of RIS elements becomes large, while the latter yields
suboptimal solutions whose performance depends on initialization. In this work,
we introduce a lightweight RIS phase design framework that provides a
closed-form solution and explicitly accounts for the trade-off between
communication and sensing, as well as proportional beam gain distribution
toward multiple sensing targets. The key idea is to partition the RIS
configuration into two parts: the first part is designed to maximize the
communication performance, while the second introduces small perturbations to
generate multiple beams for multi-target sensing. Simulation results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that it achieves
performance comparable to SDR but with significantly lower computational
complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents a switch-type attenuator working from 20 to 100 GHz. The
attenuator adopts a capacitive compensation technique to reduce phase error.
The small resistors in this work are implemented with metal lines to reduce the
intrinsic parasitic capacitance, which helps minimize the amplitude and phase
errors over a wide frequency range. Moreover, the utilization of metal lines
also reduces the chip area. In addition, a continuous tuning attenuation unit
is employed to improve the overall attenuation accuracy of the attenuator. The
passive attenuator is designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm CMOS. The
measurement results reveal a relative attenuation range of 7.5 dB with a
continuous tuning step within 20-100 GHz. The insertion loss is 1.6-3.8 dB
within the operation band, while the return losses of all states are better
than 11.5 dB. The RMS amplitude and phase errors are below 0.15 dB and
1.6{\deg}, respectively.
