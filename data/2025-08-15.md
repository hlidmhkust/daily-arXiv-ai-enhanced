### [1] [Comparative Analysis of Attention Mechanisms for Automatic Modulation Classification in Radio Frequency Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09996)
*Ferhat Ozgur Catak,Murat Kuzlu,Umit Cali*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文比较了三种注意力机制（多头注意力、因果注意力和稀疏注意力）与CNN结合在RF信号分类中的性能，提出了一种新型CNN-Transformer混合架构。实验显示基线注意力准确率最高（85.05%），而因果和稀疏注意力在保持84%以上性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索不同注意力机制在无线电信号分类中的效果，以优化实时信号处理的效率。

Method: 采用CNN-Transformer混合架构，结合三种注意力机制（多头、因果、稀疏），在RML2016.10a数据集上测试。

Result: 基线注意力准确率最高（85.05%），因果和稀疏注意力分别减少83%和75%的推理时间，性能仍超84%。

Conclusion: 不同调制方案对注意力模式有偏好，研究为实时无线电信号处理的高效注意力机制设计提供了参考。

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical component in
cognitive radio systems and spectrum management applications. This study
presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of three attention mechanisms
(i.e., baseline multi-head attention, causal attention, and sparse attention)
integrated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for radio frequency (RF)
signal classification. It proposes a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture
that leverages different attention patterns to capture temporal dependencies in
I/Q samples from the RML2016.10a dataset. The experimental results demonstrate
that while baseline attention achieves the highest accuracy of 85.05\%, causal
and sparse attention mechanisms offer significant computational advantages with
inference times reduced by 83\% and 75\% respectively, while maintaining
competitive classification performance above 84\%. The analysis reveals
distinct attention pattern preferences across different modulation schemes,
providing insights for designing efficient attention mechanisms for real-time
radio signal processing applications.

### [2] [Information Retention in Iterative Random Projection of Convex Bodies to Lower Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10218)
*Nazanin Mirhosseini*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了有界凸体在连续随机正交投影下的信息保留问题，推导了条件互信息的上界，并探讨了凸体对称性对结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维空间中凸体在连续降维过程中信息保留的量化问题，为理解随机投影对信息的影响提供理论支持。

Method: 通过连续两次随机正交投影将凸体从R^n降至R^{n-2}，推导条件互信息的上界，并推广到m次投影。

Result: 得出了条件互信息I(K_1;K_m | K_0)的上界，并发现凸体的对称性影响该上界的可达性。

Conclusion: 连续随机投影下的信息保留可以通过条件互信息量化，凸体的对称性是影响结果的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a bounded convex body $K_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$
subjected to two successive random orthogonal projections onto
$\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$, respectively. First, we project
$K_0$ orthogonally onto $U_{1}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of
$\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$, where $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_1$ is uniformly
distributed on the unit sphere $S^{n-1}$. This yields a random convex body $K_1
= \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_1}^{\perp}}(K_0) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We then repeat
the process, projecting $K_1$ orthogonally onto ${U}_{2}^{\perp}$, the
orthogonal complement of $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_2$ chosen uniformly from the
unit sphere in $\mbox{\boldmath $U$}_{1}^{\perp}$ or $S^{n-2}$, resulting in a
second random convex body $K_2 = \mathrm{Proj}_{{U_2}^{\perp}}(K_1) \subset
\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$. To quantify information retention through these sequential
dimension reductions, we derive an upper bound for the conditional mutual
information $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$. Furthermore, we extend this process to $m$
iterations and generalize the upper bound on $I(K_1;K_2 \mid K_0)$ to establish
an analogous upper bound for $I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$. Finally, we examine the
influence of $K_0$'s symmetry on the achievability of this upper bound for
$I(K_1;K_m \mid K_0)$.

### [3] [A Deep Learning based Signal Dimension Estimator with Single Snapshot Signal in Phased Array Radar Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10263)
*Yugang Ma,Yonghong Zeng,Sumei Sun,Gary Lee,Ernest Kurniawan,Francois Chin Po Shin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的信号维度估计器（DLSDE），用于单次快照观测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号维度是许多高分辨率延迟估计和方向寻找算法的前提，正确估计信号维度至关重要。

Method: 使用二维卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）自动提取信号维度特征，无需依赖特征分解和信息准则。

Result: 在32天线相控阵雷达中，DLSDE将检测信噪比提高>15dB，分辨率提高>1度。

Conclusion: DLSDE适用于空间相关或角度分离小的信号，且仅需单次快照信号，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Signal dimension, defined here as the number of copies with different delays
or angular shifts, is a prerequisite for many high-resolution delay estimation
and direction-finding algorithms in sensing and communication systems. Thus,
correctly estimating signal dimension itself becomes crucial. In this paper, we
present a deep learning-based signal dimension estimator (DLSDE) with
single-snapshot observation in the example application of phased array radar.
Unlike traditional model-based and existing deep learning-based signal
dimension estimators relying on eigen-decomposition and information criterion,
to which multiple data snapshots would be needed, the proposed DLSDE uses
two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) to automatically develop
features corresponding to the dimension of the received signal. Our study shows
that DLSDE significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of the
successful detection rate and resolution. In a phased array radar with 32
antenna elements, DLSDE improves detection Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) by >15dB
and resolution by >1{\deg}. This makes the proposed method suitable for
distinguishing multiple signals that are spatially correlated or have small
angular separation. More importantly, our solution operates with a single
snapshot signal, which is incompatible with other existing deep learning-based
methods.

### [4] [Environment Reconstruction in Terahertz Monostatic Sensing: Joint Millimeter-level Geometry Mapping and Material Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10372)
*Zitong Fang,Yejian Lyu,Ziming Yu,Chong Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的计算框架，通过结合CCA辅助的MPC估计和滑动窗口细化策略，实现了THz ISAC系统中的环境重建。实验验证了毫米级几何映射精度和可靠的材料分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: THz ISAC系统在高速通信和精确环境感知方面具有潜力，但现有方法在计算效率和精度上存在不足。本文旨在提出一种更高效且精确的环境重建框架。

Method: 采用CCA辅助的MPC估计加速参数提取，并结合滑动窗口细化策略优化几何映射。通过反射损失分析分类信道成分，并利用THz-TDS数据库进行材料识别。

Result: 几何映射的平均距离误差为4.9毫米，比文献结果提升一个数量级；材料分类通过实验验证可靠。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了THz ISAC系统的环境感知能力，为实际应用提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers high-speed
communication alongside precise environmental sensing. This paper presents a
computationally efficient framework for THz-based environment reconstruction by
integrating connected component analysis (CCA)-assisted multipath component
(MPC) estimation with a sliding-window refinement strategy. To start with, a
monostatic sensing experiment is conducted in an indoor scenario using a vector
network analyzer (VNA)-based sounder operating from 290 to 310 GHz. On one
hand, as for geometry mapping, a CCA-based region search is employed to
accelerate parameter extraction, significantly reducing the search space for
space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE)-based estimation
and achieving an 8.4 times acceleration, while preserving resolution. Further
analysis of the connected component structure enables the identification of
indoor features such as flat walls and corners. A sliding-window refinement
applied to the identified regions improves geometric mapping, achieving the
mean distance error of 4.9 mm, which is one order of magnitude better than the
literature. On the other hand, the deterministic and stochastic components of
the monostatic channel are classified through reflection loss analysis. Then,
material identification is performed by looking up the reflection loss in a THz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) database, which comprises over 200 materials
across a 0-6 THz range. Experimental results validate millimeter-level accuracy
in geometry mapping and reliable material classification, enhancing the
environmental awareness capabilities of THz ISAC systems.

### [5] [Interleaved Transceiver Design for a Continuous- Transmission MIMO-OFDM ISAC System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10430)

Conclusion: 该方法在MIMO ISAC系统中实现了高性能和计算效率的平衡，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an interleaved transceiver design method for a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) system utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms. We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design
of the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an
interleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance,
constructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For
radar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of
the beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we
tackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious
peaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware
implementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using
an alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted
waveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)
method. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction
penalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA
iterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the
case of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time.
Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in
achieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with
the fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational
efficiency.

### [6] [Second Order Channel Statistics: An Analysis for Optimal Single-user RIS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10476)
*Amy S. Inwood,Peter J. Smith,Philippa A. Martin,Graeme K. Woodward*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了可重构智能表面（RIS）系统中信道状态信息获取的挑战，重点分析了时空行为，提出了精确的LCR和AFD表达式，并验证了RIS对信道变化的影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 被动RIS无法生成导频信号或处理数据，导致信道快速变化问题，且空间变化的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用二阶统计量分析单用户RIS系统的时空行为，假设RIS-BS链路为视距链路，推导LCR和AFD表达式，并分析时空相关性。

Result: 提出了LCR和AFD的精确表达式，验证了RIS不会显著放大信道变化。

Conclusion: RIS的使用对信道变化影响较小，为RIS系统的设计和优化提供了理论支持。

Abstract: A key challenge facing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is channel
state information acquisition. Passive RISs cannot generate pilot signals or
process data, making rapid temporal changes in the channel problematic.
Additionally, the impact of spatial changes in RIS channels has not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this work, we use second order
statistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU)
RIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we
derive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link
(user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable
approximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression
attained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration
(AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived
assuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the
spatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to
channel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and
the impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an
RIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.

Conclusion: Ricean K因子对CFAS性能有显著影响，信道变化是实现高HSP的关键因素。

Abstract: We consider a single-user (SU) continuous fluid antenna system (CFAS)
employing matched filtering (MF) operating over a Ricean fading channel.
Focusing on the upper tail of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
distribution (the high SNR probability (HSP)), we derive accurate
approximations for the HSP in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions using the expected Euler
characteristic (EEC), presenting the first analytical results for a CFAS in a
Ricean environment. In the process, we provide the first closed-form expression
for the Euler characteristic density of a non-central chi-squared random field.
We then examine the impact of the Ricean K-factor on the CFAS performance,
emphasizing the critical role of channel variations in achieving a strong HSP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究雷达截面测量数据的分析方法，比较不同方法的优缺点。

Method: 使用反投影和迭代平滑重加权ℓ1最小化两种方法分析雷达截面测量数据。

Result: 反投影方法稳健准确但分辨率受限；迭代方法适用于密集散射体但精度较低。

Conclusion: 反投影适合高精度需求，迭代方法适用于密集目标但需权衡精度。

Abstract: Radar Cross Section measurement data is often analyzed using Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Radar images. This paper compares backprojection and
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization as methods to analyze radar
cross section measurements and extract radar cross section for parts of the
measured object. The main conclusion is that using backprojection images to
extract RCS is robust and accurate but is more limited by the resolution than
iterative smooth reweighted $\ell_1$-minimization. The latter method can be
used for closely spaced scatterers but is limited in accuracy.

### [9] [Unsupervised Deep Equilibrium Model Learning for Large-Scale Channel Estimation with Performance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10546)
*Haotian Tian,Lixiang Lian*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需真实信道标签的无监督学习框架，用于大规模信道估计（LCE），利用GSURE作为无监督损失函数，结合DEQ模型实现性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督深度学习方法依赖真实信道标签，限制了实际应用，因此探索无监督方法。

Result: 理论证明在温和条件下，该方法可达到监督学习的性能水平，实验验证其优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督框架在缺乏真实信道时表现优异，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel
estimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly
limits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth
channels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk
Estimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an
unbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed
noisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep
equilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network
by directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We
theoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based
unsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In
particular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a
compressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility
ensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a
good MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive
simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel
is unavailable.

### [10] [Compressive Spectral Imaging in View of Earth Observation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10569)
*Clément Thomas,Laurent Jacques,Marc Georges*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文探讨了用经典折射透镜替代衍射透镜在压缩光谱成像中的可行性，以降低成本并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测仪器通常体积大、成本高且数据量大，压缩光谱成像是一种更经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 利用折射透镜的色差特性替代昂贵的衍射透镜，并通过模拟测试其可行性，信号恢复采用Douglas-Rashford算法。

Result: 研究表明，折射透镜的色差可以替代衍射透镜，实现压缩光谱成像。

Conclusion: 折射透镜在压缩光谱成像中具有潜力，可降低成本并简化系统设计。

Abstract: Earth observation from space is an important scientific and industrial
activity that has applications in many sectors. The instruments employed are
often large, complex, and expensive. In addition, they generate large amounts
of data, which is challenging for storage and transfer purposes. Compressive
spectral imaging would be a cheaper, more efficient, and well-adapted technique
to perform Earth observation. An interesting architecture is compressive
spectral imaging with diffractive lenses, which is extremely compact. This work
investigates the possibility of replacing the diffractive lens in this system
with a classical refractive lens. Taking advantage of the chromatic aberration
of a lens makes the use of expensive diffractive lenses unnecessary.
Simulations are performed to test the feasibility of the method. Signal
recovery is a basis pursuit solved using the Douglas-Rashford algorithm.

### [11] [Towards Hybrid Lunar PNT: Error Models, Lower Bounds and Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10699)

Result: 混合导航显著提高了精度，特别是在有静态用户的情况下，结合参考站时仅需两颗可见卫星即可实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: 混合PNT方法通过结合多种技术和误差模型，为月球任务提供了更可靠和精确的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) are crucial for upcoming
lunar surface missions. Lunar satellite navigation systems are being developed,
but lack coverage during early deployment phases. Hybrid lunar PNT combining
cooperative navigation, satellite systems, and an optional reference station
offers improved accuracy and availability. This study develops realistic error
models that incorporate temporal correlations often ignored in existing works.
We derive a cooperative navigation error model considering fading and
pseudorange bias from multipath propagation, and compare three error models for
lunar satellite pseudorange and pseudorange rate signal-in-space error. These
temporal error correlation models integrate easily into Kalman filters and
provide realistic performance predictions essential for robust navigation
engines. We perform case studies to demonstrate that hybrid navigation
significantly improves accuracy, particularly with static users present. Most
notably, hybrid navigation enables optimal performance when using a lunar
reference station, achieving sub-meter accuracy with only two visible
satellites.

Result: AFDM-PLIM的感知性能优于其他AFDM-IM波形，且谱效更高。

Conclusion: AFDM-PLIM在保持所有子载波活跃的同时，提升了通信和感知性能，适用于ISAC系统。

Abstract: This study proposes an index modulation (IM) technique for affine frequency
division multiplexing (AFDM) signals and examines its communication and sensing
performance toward integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The
power levels of subcarriers are utilized as modulation indices while also
transmitting data symbols within each subcarrier. Thus, the proposed AFDM with
subcarrier power-level index modulation (AFDM-PLIM) maintains all subcarriers
active at all times to achieve a higher spectral efficiency compared to other
AFDM-IM techniques, where some of the subcarriers are turned off for IM. A low
complexity estimator and subcarrier grouping are also proposed to reduce the
computational complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, this
study also examines the delay and Doppler ambiguity functions of the proposed
AFDM-PLIM and evaluates its range estimation performance. The results show that
its sensing performance is better than AFDM-IM waveforms due to keeping all
subcarriers active at all times.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了PPG信号质量，为心血管疾病监测提供了创新工具。

Abstract: Objective. Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable
continuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising
strategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases. However,
monitoring during daily life introduces motion artifacts that can compromise
the signals. Traditional signal decomposition techniques often fail with severe
artifacts. Deep learning denoisers are more effective but have poorer
interpretability, which is critical for clinical acceptance. This study
proposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition
and deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to
integrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,
improving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model
encodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of
kernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns. The network is trained
for denoising using the PulseDB dataset and a synthetic motion artifact model
from the literature. Performance is benchmarked with PPG during daily
activities using the PPG-DaLiA dataset and compared with two reference deep
learning methods. Main results. On the synthetic dataset, the proposed method,
on average, improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from -7.07 dB to 11.23 dB
and reduced the heart rate mean absolute error (MAE) by 55%. On the PPG-DaLiA
dataset, the MAE decreased by 23%. The proposed method obtained higher SNR and
comparable MAE to the reference methods. Significance. Our method effectively
enhances the quality of PPG signals from wearable devices and enables the
extraction of meaningful waveform features, which may inspire innovative tools
for monitoring cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion: 所提方法为流体天线技术中的信号方向估计提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) technology has emerged as a promising approach in wireless
communications due to its capability of providing increased degrees of freedom
(DoFs) and exceptional design flexibility. This paper addresses the challenge
of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for aligned received signals (ARS) and
non-aligned received signals (NARS) by designing two specialized uniform FA
structures under time-constrained mobility. For ARS scenarios, we propose a
fully movable antenna configuration that maximizes the virtual array aperture,
whereas for NARS scenarios, we design a structure incorporating a fixed
reference antenna to reliably extract phase information from the signal
covariance. To overcome the limitations of large virtual arrays and limited
sample data inherent in time-varying channels (TVC), we introduce two novel DOA
estimation methods: TMRLS-MUSIC for ARS, combining Toeplitz matrix
reconstruction (TMR) with linear shrinkage (LS) estimation, and TMR-MUSIC for
NARS, utilizing sub-covariance matrices to construct virtual array responses.
Both methods employ Nystrom approximation to significantly reduce computational
complexity while maintaining estimation accuracy. Theoretical analyses and
extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
underdetermined DOA estimation using minimal FA elements, outperform
conventional methods in estimation accuracy, and substantially reduce
computational complexity.

(DoF) compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays. This
innovation not only facilitates the seamless application of super-resolution
DOA estimators but also enables robust DOA estimation, accurately localizing
more sources than the number of physical antenna elements. We introduce two
bespoke FA array structures and mobility strategies tailored to scenarios with
aligned and misaligned received signals, respectively, demonstrating a
hardware-driven approach to overcoming complexities typically addressed by
intricate algorithms. A key contribution is a light-of-sight (LoS)-centric,
closed-form DOA estimator, which first employs an eigenvalue-ratio test for
precise LoS path number detection, followed by a polynomial root-finding
procedure. This method distinctly showcases the unique advantages of FAS by
simplifying the estimation process while enhancing accuracy. Numerical results
compellingly verify that the proposed FA array designs and estimation
techniques yield an extended DoF range, deliver superior DOA accuracy, and
maintain robustness across diverse signal conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型可扩展流体天线系统（SFAS），通过动态调整孔径配置优化定位性能，无需传统信号分离或假设源场条件，显著提升了复杂场景下的定位精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于固定位置天线阵列的源定位方法依赖严格假设（近场或远场），在复杂动态场景中效果有限。

Method: 采用两阶段定位策略：第一阶段用紧凑孔径配置进行初始DOA估计，第二阶段用扩展孔径增强DOA和距离估计。

Result: 仿真表明，该方法在定位精度、计算效率和鲁棒性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: SFAS为阵列源定位提供了新范式，无需场特定假设或简化模型，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Most existing antenna array-based source localization methods rely on
fixed-position arrays (FPAs) and strict assumptions about source field
conditions (near-field or far-field), which limits their effectiveness in
complex, dynamic real-world scenarios where high-precision localization is
required. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna
system (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to
optimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,
we develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial
geometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for
initial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs
an expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed
approach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to
classify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high
localization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model
simplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based
source localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency,
and robustness to different source types.

Result: 模拟实验表明，检测器性能与数据驱动方法相当且无需大量训练样本，字母表算法优于不考虑接收器特性的方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法适用于其他化学传感器，为可靠的空气分子通信铺平了道路。

Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the
first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by existing
sensor technologies such as metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS) sensors. However,
commercially available sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive
behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumptions about linear and perfectly
molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this
gap, we propose a detector for molecule mixture communication with a general
non-linear, cross-reactive receiver (RX) array that performs approximate
maximum likelihood detection on the sensor outputs. Additionally, we introduce
an algorithm for the design of mixture alphabets that accounts for the RX
characteristics. We evaluate our detector and alphabet design algorithm through
simulations that are based on measurements reported for two commercial MOS
sensors. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves
similar symbol error rates as data-driven methods without requiring large
numbers of training samples and that the alphabet design algorithm outperforms
methods that do not account for the RX characteristics. Since the proposed
detector and alphabet design algorithm are also applicable to other chemical
sensors, they pave the way for reliable air-based MC.

*Susanne Pumpluen*

TL;DR: 提出了新的斜多项式循环码的等价和等距定义，减少已知分类，明确不同概念的重合条件，并避免重复代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有斜多项式循环码的分类不够精确，导致重复代码和冗余分类，需要更严格的定义和分类方法。

Method: 利用斜多项式循环码生成器与主左理想的对应关系，通过代数同构（保持汉明距离的等距）对代码进行分类，允许非结合环境代数。

Result: 减少了等距和等价类的数量，明确了重合条件，并扩展了代码长度的适用范围。

Conclusion: 新定义和分类方法更精确，减少了冗余，适用于更广泛的代码长度和类型。

Abstract: We propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic
codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This helps
to reduce the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes, and
state precisely when these different notions coincide. In the process, we
classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same
performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes.
  We exploit that the generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one
correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its ambient
algebra. Algebra isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called
isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal
left ideals and preserve length, dimension and Hamming distance of the codes.
We allow the ambient algebras to be nonassociative, thus eliminating the need
on restrictions on the length of the codes. The isometries between the ambient
algebras can also be used to classify corresponding linear codes equipped with
the rank metric.

Method: 基于酉群码的DSTM方案，与DRM结合，扩展反射模式数量，并提供编码和解码复杂度分析。

Result: 仿真结果表明，DRM-DSTM编码系统在准静态瑞利衰落信道中优于未编码DRM。

Conclusion: DRM-DSTM方案有效解决了CSI需求问题，为6G系统中的RIS技术提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) hold the promise of improving
significantly coverage, as well as spectral and energy efficiency in wireless
communication systems. Techniques based on RIS form a key technology for 6G
systems. An important issue in RIS technology is Channel State Information
(CSI), which is much more difficult to acquire in such systems. This work
introduces a Differential Space-Time Modulation (DSTM) scheme integrated with
Differential Reflecting Modulation (DRM) to bypass the requirement for CSI in
such systems, while providing error rate gains. The DSTM scheme is based on
unitary group codes. We first consider uncoded DRM for RIS to serve as a
reference point. Next we provide an overview of DSTM and outline the procedures
for its integration with DRM. Furthermore, we explore the extension of both the
original DRM and the coded DRM-DSTM scheme to a larger number of RIS reflecting
patterns $K$, and provide tables of codes for $K= 2, 3, 4$. Encoding and
decoding complexities are studied as well. Extensives simulation results over
quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels confirm the effectiveness of the DRM-DSTM
coded system, illustrating its advantages over uncoded DRM with proper system
parameters.

As an example, we apply this result to the class of binary memoryless sources.
Finally, we generalize the theorem to R\'enyi information measures, revealing a
deep connection between the conditional R\'enyi divergence and the conditional
Sibson's mutual information.

Conclusion: 两种方案在保持恒定包络和连续相位特性的同时，显著提升了性能，适用于物联网和NOMA场景。

Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things technologies is driven by four key
demands: ultra-low power consumption, high spectral efficiency, reduced
implementation cost, and support for massive connectivity. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes two novel modulation schemes that integrate
continuous phase modulation (CPM) with spread spectrum (SS) techniques. We
begin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.
The first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select
spreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency
while maintaining the constant-envelope property. The second scheme, referred
to as CIM-CPM-SS, introduces code index modulation (CIM), which partitions the
input bits such that one subset is mapped to phase-shift keying symbols and the
other to CPM-SS sequence indices. Both schemes are applied to downlink
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. We analyze their performance in
terms of bit error rate (BER), spectral and energy efficiency, computational
complexity, and peak-to-average power ratio characteristics under nonlinear
amplifier conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that both schemes
outperform conventional approaches in BER while preserving the benefits of
constant-envelope, continuous-phase signaling. Furthermore, they achieve higher
spectral and energy efficiency and exhibit strong resilience to nonlinear
distortions in downlink NOMA scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of communication and synthetic
aperture radar (SAR)-based remote sensing in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
systems to provide real-time SAR imaging and information transmission.
Considering the high-mobility characteristics of satellite channels and limited
processing capabilities of satellite payloads, we propose an integrated
communication and remote sensing architecture based on an orthogonal
delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) signal waveform. Both communication
and SAR imaging functionalities are achieved with an integrated transceiver
onboard the LEO satellite, utilizing the same waveform and radio frequency (RF)
front-end. Based on such an architecture, we propose a transmission protocol
compatible with the 5G NR standard using downlink pilots for joint channel
estimation and SAR imaging. Furthermore, we design a unified signal processing
framework for the integrated satellite receiver to simultaneously achieve
high-performance channel sensing, low-complexity channel equalization and
interference-free SAR imaging. Finally, the performance of the proposed
integrated system is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis and extensive
simulations in the sub-6 GHz band. Moreover, a software-defined radio (SDR)
prototype is presented to validate its effectiveness for real-time SAR imaging
and information transmission in satellite direct-connect user equipment (UE)

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了MA部署中的实时性问题，为城市低空通信提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In complex urban environments, dynamic obstacles and multipath effects lead
to significant link attenuation and pervasive coverage blind spots.
Conventional approaches based on large-scale fixed antenna arrays and UAV
trajectory optimization struggle to balance energy efficiency, real-time
adaptation, and spatial flexibility. The movable antenna (MA) technology has
emerged as a promising solution, offering enhanced spatial flexibility and
reduced energy consumption to overcome the bottlenecks of urban low-altitude
communications. However, MA deployment faces a critical velocity mismatch
between UAV mobility and mechanical repositioning latency, undermining
real-time link optimization and security assurance. To overcome this, we
propose a predictive MA-UAV collaborative control framework. First, optimal
antenna positions are derived via secrecy rate maximization. Second, a
Transformer-enhanced long short-term memory (LSTM) network predicts future MA
positions by capturing spatio-temporal correlations in antenna trajectories.
Extensive simulations demonstrate superior prediction accuracy (NMSE reduction
exceeds 49\%) and communication reliability versus current popular benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MVT格式已使用近十年，无法适应新型地理空间数据源的需求，如数据量激增和AI自动化检测。

Method: 提出MLT格式，重新设计以满足现代需求，并通过实验模拟用户会话验证其性能。

Result: MLT压缩比最高提升3倍，解码速度快3倍，处理性能显著增强。

Conclusion: MLT为下一代地图渲染器奠定基础，支持GPU处理，突破摩尔定律限制。

Abstract: The Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format is widely considered the leading open
standard for large-scale map visualization, as evidenced by its widespread
adoption by major technology companies such as AWS, Meta, and Microsoft for
their products and services. However, MVT was developed nearly a decade ago
and, consequently, does not fully align with the capabilities of new geospatial
data sources that are characterized by rapidly increasing data volumes due to
advancements in geospatial sensors and automated detection through artificial
intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the MapLibre Tile (MLT) format, a
novel vector tile specification designed from the ground up to address the
limitations of MVT. Our experiments, simulating user sessions on widely used
basemap datasets, demonstrate that MLT achieves up to three times better
compression ratios compared to MVT on encoded tilesets, with over six times
better on certain large tiles. Additionally, MLT offers decoding speeds that
are up to three times faster and significantly enhances processing performance.
MLT also introduces new functionalities and is specifically designed to lay the
foundation for the next generation of map renderers, which we expect to
entirely offload processing to the GPU, thereby overcoming the stagnation of
Moore`s law.

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We

chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the
IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes),
we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned
transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are
trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated
via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152
achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall
balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into
intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full
surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and
postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models
for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation
scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across
procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap
between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its
real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing
surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked
state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective
designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel
architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert
annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on
reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that
improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled
surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,
SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging
surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model
training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and
advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest
gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery
video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and
clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the
foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical

Conclusion: DINOMotion在实时运动跟踪中表现出色，尤其适用于大位移场景。

Abstract: Accurate tissue motion tracking is critical to ensure treatment outcome and
safety in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy. This is typically achieved by
registration of sequential images, but existing methods often face challenges
with large misalignments and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we
introduce DINOMotion, a novel deep learning framework based on DINOv2 with
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers for robust, efficient, and interpretable
motion tracking. DINOMotion automatically detects corresponding landmarks to
derive optimal image registration, enhancing interpretability by providing
explicit visual correspondences between sequential images. The integration of
LoRA layers reduces trainable parameters, improving training efficiency, while
DINOv2's powerful feature representations offer robustness against large
misalignments. Unlike iterative optimization-based methods, DINOMotion directly
computes image registration at test time. Our experiments on volunteer and
patient datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating both linear and
nonlinear transformations, achieving Dice scores of 92.07% for the kidney,
90.90% for the liver, and 95.23% for the lung, with corresponding Hausdorff
distances of 5.47 mm, 8.31 mm, and 6.72 mm, respectively. DINOMotion processes
each scan in approximately 30ms and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in handling large misalignments. These results highlight
its potential as a robust and interpretable solution for real-time motion
tracking in 2D-Cine MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Abstract: The advancement of imaging devices and countless image data generated
everyday impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image
denoising. In this paper, we present a computationally simple denoising
algorithm, termed Haar-tSVD, aiming to explore the nonlocal self-similarity
prior and leverage the connection between principal component analysis (PCA)
and the Haar transform under circulant representation. We show that global and
local patch correlations can be effectively captured through a unified
tensor-singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection with the Haar transform.
This results in a one-step, highly parallelizable filtering method that
eliminates the need for learning local bases to represent image patches,
striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Furthermore, we
introduce an adaptive noise estimation scheme based on a CNN estimator and
eigenvalue analysis to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the proposed
method. Experiments on different real-world denoising tasks validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of Haar-tSVD for noise removal and detail
preservation. Datasets, code and results are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CT减少辐射但传统方法产生条纹伪影，现有深度学习方法易过度平滑，扩散模型效率低且不稳定。

Method: 提出CvG-Diff模型，利用确定性退化操作和跨视图相关性，结合EPCT和SPDPS技术优化重建。

Result: 在18视图CT上达到38.34 dB PSNR和0.9518 SSIM，仅需10步。

Conclusion: CvG-Diff在稀疏视图CT重建中优于现有方法，高效且稳定。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reduces radiation exposure by
subsampling projection views, but conventional reconstruction methods produce
severe streak artifacts with undersampled data. While deep-learning-based
methods enable single-step artifact suppression, they often produce
over-smoothed results under significant sparsity. Though diffusion models
improve reconstruction via iterative refinement and generative priors, they
require hundreds of sampling steps and struggle with stability in highly sparse
regimes. To tackle these concerns, we present the Cross-view Generalized
Diffusion Model (CvG-Diff), which reformulates sparse-view CT reconstruction as
a generalized diffusion process. Unlike existing diffusion approaches that rely
on stochastic Gaussian degradation, CvG-Diff explicitly models image-domain
artifacts caused by angular subsampling as a deterministic degradation
operator, leveraging correlations across sparse-view CT at different sample
rates. To address the inherent artifact propagation and inefficiency of
sequential sampling in generalized diffusion model, we introduce two
innovations: Error-Propagating Composite Training (EPCT), which facilitates
identifying error-prone regions and suppresses propagated artifacts, and
Semantic-Prioritized Dual-Phase Sampling (SPDPS), an adaptive strategy that
prioritizes semantic correctness before detail refinement. Together, these
innovations enable CvG-Diff to achieve high-quality reconstructions with
minimal iterations, achieving 38.34 dB PSNR and 0.9518 SSIM for 18-view CT
using only \textbf{10} steps on AAPM-LDCT dataset. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of CvG-Diff over state-of-the-art sparse-view CT
reconstruction methods. The code is available at

Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated (video) content (UGC) has driven increased
demand for research on no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment
(VQA). NR-VQA is a key component for large-scale video quality monitoring in
social media and streaming applications where a pristine reference is not
available. This paper proposes a novel NR-VQA model based on spatio-temporal
fragmentation driven by inter-frame variations. By leveraging these inter-frame
differences, the model progressively analyses quality-sensitive regions at
multiple levels: frames, patches, and fragmented frames. It integrates frames,
fragmented residuals, and fragmented frames aligned with residuals to
effectively capture global and local information. The model extracts both 2D
and 3D features in order to characterize these spatio-temporal variations.
Experiments conducted on five UGC datasets and against state-of-the-art models
ranked our proposed method among the top 2 in terms of average rank correlation
(DIVA-VQA-L: 0.898 and DIVA-VQA-B: 0.886). The improved performance is offered
at a low runtime complexity, with DIVA-VQA-B ranked top and DIVA-VQA-L third on
average compared to the fastest existing NR-VQA method. Code and models are

Abstract: We analyze the variability among segmentations of cranial blood vessels in 2D
DSA performed by multiple annotators in order to characterize and quantify
segmentation uncertainty. We use this analysis to quantify segmentation
uncertainty and discuss ways it can be used to guide additional annotations and
to develop uncertainty-aware automatic segmentation methods.
