### [1] [Improved Bounds on Access-Redundancy Tradeoffs in Quantized Linear Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00183)
*Ching-Fang Li,Mary Wootters*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何用少量查询计算量化线性函数的问题，改进了先前的不可能性结果，并首次研究了近似恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限查询次数下精确或近似计算量化线性函数的挑战，特别是在二元集合A的情况下。

Method: 通过改进先前的不可能性结果，并提出了近似恢复的构造方法，特别是在ε=0.1时优于精确方案。

Result: 证明了先前块构造的最优性，并展示了近似恢复构造的性能优势。

Conclusion: 论文在量化线性函数计算方面取得了理论和构造上的进展，特别是在近似恢复方面开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Consider the problem of computing quantized linear functions with only a few
queries. Formally, given $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^k$, our goal is to encode
$\mathbf{x}$ as $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, for $n > k$, so that for any
$\mathbf{w} \in A^k$, $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ can be computed using at most
$\ell$ queries to $\mathbf{c}$. Here, $A$ is some finite set; in this paper we
focus on the case where $|A| = 2$.
  Prior work \emph{(Ramkumar, Raviv, and Tamo, Trans. IT, 2024)} has given
constructions and established impossibility results for this problem. We give
improved impossibility results, both for the general problem, and for the
specific class of construction (block construction) presented in that work. The
latter establishes that the block constructions of prior work are optimal
within that class.
  We also initiate the study of \emph{approximate} recovery for this problem,
where the goal is not to recover $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}$ exactly but rather
to approximate it up to a parameter $\varepsilon > 0$. We give several
constructions, and give constructions for $\varepsilon = 0.1$ that outperform
our impossibility result for exact schemes.

### [2] [Channel Estimation for Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces: From Model-Based Approaches to Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00268)
*Jian Xiao,Ji Wang,Qimei Cui,Yucang Yang,Xingwang Li,Dusit Niyato,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了柔性智能超表面（FIM）辅助毫米波通信系统中的信道估计问题，提出了基于模型和深度学习的框架，其中层次傅里叶神经算子（H-FNO）显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FIM通过动态变形实现多径信号相长干涉，但其性能依赖于高维变形空间中的准确信道状态信息获取。

Method: 开发了基于模型的框架（函数逼近和稀疏信号恢复）和深度学习框架（FNO和H-FNO），用于信道估计。

Result: H-FNO在估计精度和导频效率上显著优于基准方法，并能准确重建非线性信道响应。

Conclusion: H-FNO通过学习适应FIM物理几何的各向异性空间滤波器，解决了高维变形空间中的信道估计问题。

Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) offer a new solution for wireless
communications by introducing morphological degrees of freedom, dynamically
morphing their three-dimensional shape to ensure multipath signals interfere
constructively. However, realizing the desired performance gains in FIM systems
is critically dependent on acquiring accurate channel state information across
a continuous and high-dimensional deformation space. Therefore, this paper
investigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted
millimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks
that structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation
and kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the
inherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the
estimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel
estimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a
Fourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator
in the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the
continuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with
mesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO)
architecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy
of spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO
significantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and
pilot efficiency. In particular, the interpretability analysis show that the
proposed H-FNO learns an anisotropic spatial filter adapted to the physical
geometry of FIM and is capable of accurately reconstructing the non-linear
channel response across the continuous deformation space.

### [3] [Active IRS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications with Extended Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00379)
*Yuan Fang,Xianxin Song,Huazhou Hou,Ziguo Zhong,Xianghao Yu,Jie Xu,Yongming Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了主动智能反射面（IRS）支持的集成传感与通信（ISAC），通过优化波束成形最小化传感CRB，并验证了主动IRS的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非视距（NLoS）区域中通信和传感的反射路径损耗问题，提升系统性能。

Method: 联合优化基站和主动IRS的波束成形，提出交替优化算法解决非凸问题。

Result: 主动IRS在最大增益下工作，显著优于被动IRS。

Conclusion: 主动IRS在ISAC中具有显著优势，提出的算法高效且实用。

Abstract: This paper studies the active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), in which an active IRS is
deployed to assist the base station (BS) in serving multiple communication
users (CUs) and simultaneously sensing an \emph{extended} target at the
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. The active IRS has the capability of
amplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path
loss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix.
Accordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the
reflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject
to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs,
the transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power
amplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem
is highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this
challenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the
sensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for
which the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose
two efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain
high-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the
inherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification
scaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the
signal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings.
Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC
compared to its passive IRSs counterparts.

### [4] [LO-Aware Adaptive Modulation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00458)
*Jiuyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对Rydberg原子接收器的LO感知自适应调制方案（LOAM），通过动态适应复杂衰落信道系数，显著提升了量子检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rydberg原子接收器在无线通信中具有超高灵敏度，但仅能检测信号幅度而丢失相位信息。现有调制方案在量子检测机制下表现不佳，因此需要开发新的调制方法。

Method: 提出LOAM方案，动态适应信道系数，最大化星座点间最小幅度差，并根据参考信号强度选择对称或非对称星座分布。

Result: 仿真结果显示，LOAM性能优于传统调制方案（如QAM、PSK、PAM），增益超过45 dB。

Conclusion: LOAM为Rydberg原子接收器提供了一种高效的调制方案，显著提升了量子检测性能。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers represent a revolutionary quantum technology
for wireless communications, offering unprecedented sensitivity beyond
conventional radio frequency (RF) antennas. However, these receivers detect
only signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference
signals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery,
existing modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly
with this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough
LO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA
receivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM
maximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points,
ensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive
co-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of
reference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM
generates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals,
it adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the
threshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the
transformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB
over conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).

### [5] [Towards a Measure Theory of Semantic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00525)
*George M. Coghill*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文批判了Floridi的强语义信息理论，并提出了一种基于单位圆的新方法，解决了Bar-Hillel-Carnap悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floridi的理论未能完全解决Bar-Hillel-Carnap悖论，因此需要一种新的方法来量化语义信息。

Method: 提出了一种基于单位圆的类比方法，借鉴了冯·诺伊曼的量子概率理论，构建了一个满足Floridi要求的度量空间。

Result: 新方法成功解决了悖论，同时发现相互矛盾的消息具有相同的信息量。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅满足了Floridi的要求，还提供了更合理的语义信息量化方式。

Abstract: A classic account of the quantification of semantic information is that of
Bar-Hiller and Carnap. Their account proposes an inverse relation between the
informativeness of a statement and its probability. However, their approach
assigns the maximum informativeness to a contradiction: which Floridi refers to
as the Bar-Hillel-Carnap paradox. He developed a novel theory founded on a
distance metric and parabolic relation, designed to remove this paradox.
Unfortunately is approach does not succeed in that aim.
  In this paper I critique Floridi's theory of strongly semantic information on
its own terms and show where it succeeds and fails. I then present a new
approach based on the unit circle (a relation that has been the basis of
theories from basic trigonometry to quantum theory). This is used, by analogy
with von Neumann's quantum probability to construct a measure space for
informativeness that meets all the requirements stipulated by Floridi and
removes the paradox. In addition, while contradictions and tautologies have
zero informativeness, it is found that messages which are contradictory to each
other are equally informative. The utility of this is explained by means of an
example.

foundations enable the closed-form BER analysis of uplink NOMA systems with
dynamic SIC decoding under Rayleigh fading channels, supporting analytical
expressions for various modulation schemes and system configurations.

### [7] [Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596)
*Xiang Zhang,Zhou Li,Shuangyang Li,Kai Wan,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化联邦学习中的安全聚合问题，从信息论角度分析了通信和密钥使用的最优界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注协议设计和计算保证，但对信息论基础限制的理解不足，尤其是在去中心化环境中。

Method: 考虑一个由K个用户组成的网络，每个用户持有私有输入，目标是安全计算所有输入的总和。通过信息论方法分析通信和密钥需求。

Result: 确定了最优速率区域，表明每个用户至少需要传输一个符号、持有一个密钥符号，且所有用户需共同持有至少K-1个独立密钥符号。

Conclusion: 研究结果为分布式学习系统中设计安全且通信高效的协议提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively
learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held
datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the
intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques
are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite
growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on
protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the
fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal
bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,
where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the
problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic
perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,
each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who
aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires
that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up
to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies
the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In
particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input
sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at
least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no
fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the
fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of
provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning
systems.

### [8] [Deep Learning-Based Rate-Adaptive CSI Feedback for Wideband XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00626)
*Zhenyu Liu,Yi Ma,Rahim Tafazolli*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: WideNLNet-CA是一个用于宽带近场XL-MIMO系统中高效CSI反馈的深度学习框架，通过轻量级编码器-解码器架构和动态压缩比适应模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中XL-MIMO系统的频谱效率增益依赖于精确高效的CSI反馈，但宽带场景下的近场球面波传播和频域波束分裂效应带来了挑战。

Method: 采用轻量级编码器-解码器架构，结合多阶段下采样和上采样，引入残差块捕获多尺度特征，并通过动态压缩比适应模块灵活调整特征选择。

Result: 在各种压缩比和带宽下，WideNLNet-CA均优于现有压缩感知和深度学习方法，同时保持快速推理和低存储需求。

Conclusion: WideNLNet-CA为宽带近场XL-MIMO系统中的CSI反馈提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial
for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely
large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the
combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent
beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI
representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a
rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback
in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight
encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling,
incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex
multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio
adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically
modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling
flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model.
Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms
existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various
compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low
model storage requirements.

Result: 验证了表达式在单跨和多跨光纤链路中的高准确性，并展示了其在OSNR优化中的应用。

Conclusion: 该闭式表达式为宽带系统设计提供了高效且准确的工具。

Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman
scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform
attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be
accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an
approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting
for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against
numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for
both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an
inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be
utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile
through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.

### [10] [RIS-MAE: A Self-Supervised Modulation Classification Method Based on Raw IQ Signals and Masked Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00274)
*Yunfei Liu,Mingxuan Liu,Wupeng Xie,Xinzhu Liu,Wenxue Liu,Yangang Sun,Xin Qiu,Cui Yuan,Jinhai Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RIS-MAE的自监督学习框架，用于解决自动调制分类（AMC）中的关键问题，如特征丢失和依赖标注数据。该方法通过掩码自编码器从原始IQ序列中学习特征，并在少样本和跨域任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动调制分类（AMC）在智能无线通信系统中至关重要，但现有方法存在特征丢失和依赖大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 提出RIS-MAE框架，利用掩码自编码器从原始IQ序列中学习信号特征，通过随机掩码和重建捕捉时域特征。

Result: 在四个数据集上测试，RIS-MAE在少样本和跨域任务中优于现有方法，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RIS-MAE通过自监督学习解决了AMC中的关键问题，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a basic technology in
intelligent wireless communication systems. It is important for tasks such as
spectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent
years, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,
mainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use
time-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key
modulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication
conditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a
large amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.
To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called
RIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from
unlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking
and reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as
amplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable
representations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it
performs better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.
Notably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets
with only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization
ability and potential for real-world deployment.

*Chengwang Ji,Kehui Li,Haiquan Lu,Qiaoyan Peng,Jintao Wang,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RDARS架构的6G无线网络优化方法，通过联合优化基站和RDARS的波束成形矩阵以及RDARS的模式切换矩阵，最大化加权和速率（WSR）。采用PWM算法结合MM和WMMSE方法，并引入模型驱动DL以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS和DAS系统在6G网络中性能有限，RDARS架构的动态工作模式配置能带来额外选择增益，因此需要优化其波束成形和模式切换以提升系统性能。

Method: 提出PWM算法，结合MM和WMMSE方法，并集成模型驱动DL以加速收敛和提升性能。

Conclusion: RDARS架构结合PWM算法和DL方法，显著提升了6G网络的性能，验证了其潜力。

Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a
promising architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In
particular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system
brings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In
this paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly
optimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as
well as mode switching matrix at RDARS. The optimization problem is challenging
to be solved due to the non-convex objective function and mixed integer binary
constraint. To this end, a penalty term-based weight minimum mean square error
(PWM) algorithm is proposed by integrating the majorization-minimization (MM)
and weight minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods. To further escape the
local optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is
integrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the
convergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed
and improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to show
that the PWM-based beamforming network (PWM-BFNet) can reduce the number of
iterations by half and achieve performance improvements of 26.53% and 103.2% at
the scenarios of high total transmit power and a large number of RDARS transmit
elements (TEs), respectively.

Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is intrinsically amalgamated with
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent

optimization-based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit
beamforming matrices, STAR-RIS configurations, and rate-splitting parameters.
STAR-RIS attains 360-degree full-plane coverage, while RSMA provides a
prominent gain by efficiently managing interference. Numerical results reveal a
strong synergy between RSMA and STAR-RIS, demonstreating significant EE gains
over reflective RIS and spatial division multiple access (SDMA).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的多模态波束预测框架，通过对比学习提升跨模态一致性，实验显示性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂动态的传播环境使毫米波波束预测面临挑战，传统基于实时信道状态信息（CSI）的方法计算成本高且精度不足。

Method: 采用VLM驱动的对比学习框架，整合多模态数据，通过模态特定编码器对齐图像和LiDAR特征，并引入文本模态增强一致性。

Result: 在DeepSense-6G数据集上，DBA-Score达到0.9016，平均提升1.46%。

Conclusion: VLM框架在复杂环境中表现出色，为波束预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and
dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the
powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM)
provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time
channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to
maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven
contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates
multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal
consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and
LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts
and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which
further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G
dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding.
Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score
(DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.

### [14] [Feasibility of Extracting Skin Nerve Activity from Electrocardiogram Recorded at A Low Sampling Frequency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00494)
*Youngsun Kong,Farnoush Baghestani,I-Ping Chen,Ki Chon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究表明，皮肤神经活动（SKNA）可以从低采样频率（如0.5 kHz或1 kHz）的ECG信号中提取，无需传统的高采样频率（>2 kHz）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SKNA提取需要高采样频率（>2 kHz），但许多ECG设备（尤其是可穿戴设备）采样频率较低（≤1 kHz）。研究发现150-500 Hz频段在交感神经刺激中占主导，因此假设低采样频率也可提取SKNA。

Method: 从16名参与者中收集ECG信号，在交感神经刺激下，将信号重采样为0.5、1和4 kHz，并进行统计分析和分类性能评估。

Result: SKNA指标在0.5、1和4 kHz采样频率下无显著差异，表明低采样频率ECG设备也可可靠收集SKNA。

Conclusion: 常规低采样频率ECG设备可用于SKNA提取，前提是肌肉伪影污染最小。

Abstract: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has
been a promising non-invasive surrogate for accurate and effective assessment
of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Typically, SKNA extraction requires a
higher sampling frequency than the typical ECG recording requirement (> 2 kHz)
because analysis tools extract SKNA from the 0.5-1 kHz frequency band. However,
ECG recording systems commonly provide a sampling frequency of 1 kHz or lower,
particularly for wearable devices. Our recent power spectral analysis exhibited
that 150-500 Hz frequency bands are dominant during sympathetic stimulation.
Therefore, we hypothesize that SKNA can be extracted from ECG sampled at a
lower sampling frequency. We collected ECG signals from 16 participants during
SNS stimulation and resampled the signals at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our statistical
analyses of significance, classification performance, and reliability indicate
no significant difference between SKNA indices derived from ECG signals sampled
at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our findings indicate that conventional ECG devices,
which are limited to low sampling rates due to resource constraints or outdated
guidelines, can be used to reliably collect SKNA if muscle artifact
contamination is minimal.

Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable
pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected
reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional
adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and
the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power
spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel
selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the
off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different
frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the
on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT
filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband
signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking
technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter,
enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and
strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.

Conclusion: 研究这些挑战将提升HTS系统性能，为地面网络覆盖不足地区提供高速数据服务。

Abstract: With its wide coverage and uninterrupted service, satellite communication is
a critical technology for next-generation 6G communications. High throughput
satellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing
techniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the
growing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review
the-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated
challenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware
foundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user
terminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource
allocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation
schemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to
non-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods
for the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference
cancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as
single gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and
hybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges
related to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of
gateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight
development, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these
topics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally
delivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.

TL;DR: GEPAR3D是一种新颖的方法，将实例检测和多类分割统一为一步，显著提高了CBCT中牙齿根尖的细分精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT中的牙齿细分，尤其是根尖细分，对正畸中的根吸收评估至关重要，但现有方法存在挑战。

Method: 结合统计形状模型作为几何先验，采用深度分水岭方法，将每个牙齿建模为连续的3D能量盆地。

Result: 在多个测试集上，GEPAR3D的平均Dice相似系数达到95.0%，召回率提高9.5%。

Conclusion: GEPAR3D显著提升了根尖细分质量，有望改善临床决策，并已公开实现和数据集。

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains
challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical
for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel
approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a
single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a
Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical
context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency
constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a
continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This
instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex
root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our
method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public
medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance,
averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the
second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test
sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root
segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root
resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We
provide the implementation and dataset at https://github.com/tomek1911/GEPAR3D.

TL;DR: 虚拟染色技术通过深度学习生成荧光图像，但其对下游任务（如分割或分类）的实用性取决于任务网络的能力。研究发现，虚拟染色可能不会改善甚至降低任务性能，尤其是当任务网络能力足够强时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究虚拟染色技术在实际生物医学任务中的实用性，特别是其对下游任务（如分割或分类）的影响。

Method: 使用生物数据集，比较无标记、虚拟染色和真实荧光图像在下游任务中的表现，评估任务网络能力的影响。

Result: 虚拟染色的效果取决于任务网络的能力，当网络能力足够强时，虚拟染色可能不会改善甚至降低任务性能。

Conclusion: 在决定是否使用虚拟染色时，应考虑任务网络的能力。

Abstract: Virtual staining, or in-silico-labeling, has been proposed to computationally
generate synthetic fluorescence images from label-free images by use of deep
learning-based image-to-image translation networks. In most reported studies,
virtually stained images have been assessed only using traditional image
quality measures such as structural similarity or signal-to-noise ratio.
However, in biomedical imaging, images are typically acquired to facilitate an
image-based inference, which we refer to as a downstream biological or clinical
task. This study systematically investigates the utility of virtual staining
for facilitating clinically relevant downstream tasks (like segmentation or
classification) with consideration of the capacity of the deep neural networks
employed to perform the tasks. Comprehensive empirical evaluations were
conducted using biological datasets, assessing task performance by use of
label-free, virtually stained, and ground truth fluorescence images. The
results demonstrated that the utility of virtual staining is largely dependent
on the ability of the segmentation or classification task network to extract
meaningful task-relevant information, which is related to the concept of
network capacity. Examples are provided in which virtual staining does not
improve, or even degrades, segmentation or classification performance when the
capacity of the associated task network is sufficiently large. The results
demonstrate that task network capacity should be considered when deciding
whether to perform virtual staining.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督的3D多任务UNet模型，结合血管先验知识，用于颅内动脉瘤的检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉瘤（IAs）在影像中难以准确检测和分析，且缺乏标注数据，需开发高效算法。

Method: 使用Frangi血管滤波器生成先验知识，结合多任务UNet进行检测和分割，并在Lausanne和ADAM数据集上验证。

Result: 模型在分割（Dice=0.614）和检测（灵敏度92.9%）上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在颅内动脉瘤的检测和分割中表现出优越性能，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels
that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their
small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to
perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are
critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large
public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for
developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we
proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates
vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in
time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA
detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to
derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention
block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary
branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth
segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same
database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it
externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm
segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate =
1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉狭窄是缺血性心脏病的主要风险因素，现有深度学习方法受限于标注数据不足和类别不平衡。

Result: 在大规模内部和公共数据集上表现优异，尤其在数据有限时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升狭窄评估的可靠性，优化数据利用。

Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to
increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require
meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical
visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed
decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have
shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of
stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent
approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and
class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach
that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic
lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on
lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset
sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house
dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach
maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with
limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment
of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable
decision support.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖领域特定或无训练先验，FMPlug通过简单但强大的洞察力，释放领域无关基础模型的潜力。

Method: 引入时间自适应预热策略和锐利高斯性正则化，增强基础流匹配先验。

Result: 在图像超分辨率和高斯去模糊任务上，FMPlug显著优于现有基于基础流匹配先验的方法。

Conclusion: FMPlug通过创新策略，成功提升了基础模型在逆问题中的性能。

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation
flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike
traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug
smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between
observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By
introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity
regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation
models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors
by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious
challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of
in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained
by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard,
vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we
propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative
execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To
support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging
scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint
selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent
DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the
clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to
single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight,
and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of
distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness
and contribute to long-term space sustainability.
