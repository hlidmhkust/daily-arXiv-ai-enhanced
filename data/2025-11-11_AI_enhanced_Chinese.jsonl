Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels.

However, most ICM frameworks utilize learned image compression (LIC) models that operate at a fixed rate and require separate training for each target bitrate, which may limit their practical applications. Existing variable rate LIC approaches mitigate this limitation but typically depend on training, increasing computational cost and deployment complexity. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free, adaptive quantization step size control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By leveraging both channel-wise entropy dependencies and spatial scale parameters predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method preserves semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. The bitrate can be continuously controlled through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u673a\u5668\u7f16\u7801(ICM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u533a\u57df\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7c97\u91cf\u5316\u6b21\u8981\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ICM\u6846\u67b6\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u7684LIC\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u901a\u9053\u71b5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u5148\u9a8c\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u957f\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u53d8\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe11.07%\u7684BD-rate\u8282\u7701\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ICM\u4e2d\u53ef\u53d8\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights.

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes.

Specifically, leveraging the low-rank and sparse characteristics of the mmWave channel matrix, a two-phase rank-aware compressed sensing framework is proposed for efficient channel estimation and reconstruction. In the first phase, a robust rank-one matrix completion (R1MC) algorithm is used to reconstruct part of the observed channel matrix through low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). To address abrupt rank changes caused by user mobility, a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model is established that leverages temporal rank correlations across consecutive time instances to enable adaptive observation matrix completion, thereby improving estimation accuracy under dynamic conditions. In the second phase, a rank-aware block orthogonal matching pursuit (RA-BOMP) algorithm is developed for sparse channel recovery with low computational complexity. Furthermore, a rank-aware measurement matrix design is introduced to improve angle estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing benchmark algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior channel estimation performance while significantly reducing computational complexity and training overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u65f6\u53d8\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u9053\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u65f6\u53d8\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u79e9\u7a81\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u79e9\u4e00\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u79e9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c2\u6d4b\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f00\u53d1\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u5757\u6b63\u4ea4\u5339\u914d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u9053\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u6d4b\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u65f6\u53d8\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, the procedure requires considerable scanning time, leading to patient discomfort and the potential for motion-induced artifacts. Reducing the number of projection views while keeping the time per view unchanged provides a mechanism to shorten the scanning time. However, this approach leads to increased sampling artifacts, higher noise, and hence limited image quality. To address these issues, we propose sparseview SPECT image enhancement (SPASHT), inherently training the algorithm to improve performance on defect-detection tasks. We objectively evaluated SPASHT on the clinical task of detecting perfusion defects in a retrospective clinical study using data from patients who underwent MPI SPECT, where the defects were clinically realistic and synthetically inserted. The study was conducted for different numbers of fewer projection views, including 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 of the typical projection views for MPI SPECT. Performance on the detection task was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Images obtained with SPASHT yielded significantly improved AUC compared to those obtained with the sparse-view protocol for all the considered numbers of fewer projection views. To further assess performance, a human observer study on the task of detecting perfusion defects was conducted. Results from the human observer study showed improved detection performance with images reconstructed using SPASHT compared to those from the sparse-view protocol. The results provide evidence of the efficacy of SPASHT in improving the quality of sparse-view MPI SPECT images and motivate further clinical validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPASHT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u5fc3\u808c\u704c\u6ce8SPECT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6295\u5f71\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u7f29\u77ed\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc3\u808c\u704c\u6ce8SPECT\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u60a3\u8005\u4e0d\u9002\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002\u51cf\u5c11\u6295\u5f71\u89c6\u56fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f29\u77ed\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPASHT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57281/6\u30011/3\u548c1/2\u6807\u51c6\u6295\u5f71\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SPASHT\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86AUC\u503c\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "SPASHT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6295\u5f71MPI SPECT\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, existing ROI-based video encryption methods suffer from insufficient flexibility and lack of a unified evaluation system. To address these issues, we propose a visual perception-based tunable framework and evaluation benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI encryption. Our scheme introduces three key contributions: 1) A ROI region recognition module based on visual perception network is proposed to accurately identify the ROI region in videos. 2) A three-level tunable encryption strategy is implemented while balancing security and real-time performance. 3) A unified ROI encryption evaluation benchmark is developed to provide a standardized quantitative platform for subsequent research. This triple strategy provides new solution and significant unified performance evaluation methods for ROI selective encryption field. Experimental results indicate that the proposed benchmark can comprehensively measure the performance of the ROI selective encryption.

The conventional localization methods rely on complex infrastructure for providing cooperative anchor nodes that often contribute to higher network overload and energy consumption. To address this, the passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be leveraged as perfectly synced reference nodes for developing anchor-free localization. This work proposes a two-stage framework for localizing user equipment (UE) equipped with multiple antennas. At first, we show that the optimal RIS phase shift matrix maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RIS-assisted anchor-free localization is independent of UE location, making the proposed framework scalable without increasing the overhead to control RIS. The proposed two-stage framework first obtains a coarse estimate of UE's location by correlating the received RIS-reflected signal with a dictionary constructed using line-of-sight (LoS) components at a few reference positions. Next, the coarse estimate is refined using Newton's refinement. The numerical results show that the small-sized dictionary, constructed using fewer reference positions, can be employed for accurate localization with a slight increase in the required number of refinement iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u951aRIS\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u548c\u725b\u987f\u7ec6\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u951a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5229\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540c\u6b65\u53c2\u8003\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u951a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u63a5\u6536\u7684RIS\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u4f4d\u7f6e\u89c6\u8ddd\u5206\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5b57\u5178\u83b7\u5f97\u7c97\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u725b\u987f\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7c97\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\u53c2\u8003\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5b57\u5178\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u7ec6\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u52a0RIS\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65e0\u951a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper presents an efficient zero-shot diffusion-based compression method that runs substantially faster than existing methods, while maintaining performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations.

Dimensional groups, or $\u03c0-$groups, allow for the reduction of the number of parameters affecting the dimensionless measured quantities.\n  In many real-world applications, the main interest is in estimating only a subset of the variables affecting the measurements. An example is estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a plate from Eddy Current Testing data, regardless of the lift-off of the probe, which may be either uncertain and/or variable. Alternatively, one may seek to estimate thickness and lift-off while neglecting the influence of the electrical conductivity, or to estimate the electrical conductivity and the lift-off, neglecting the thickness.\n  This is where the concept of invariants becomes crucial. An invariant transformation is a mathematical mapping that makes the measured signal independent of one or more of these uncertain parameters. Invariant transformations provide a way to isolate useful signals from uncertain ones, improving the accuracy and reliability of the NdT results.\n  The main contribution of this paper is a systematic method to derive \\emph{invariant} transformations for frequency domain Eddy Current Testing data, via dimensional analysis. The proposed method is compatible with real-time and in-line operations.\n  After its theoretical foundation is introduced, the method is validated by means of experimental data, with reference to configurations consisting of plates with different thicknesses, electrical conductivity, and lift-off.

However, the large data volume generated by high-density transducer arrays presents a major challenge for realizing compact and power-efficient wearable systems. This paper presents a photoacoustic imaging receiver (RX) that embeds compressive sensing directly into the hardware to address this bottleneck. The RX integrates 16 AFEs and four matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM) SAR ADCs that perform energy- and area-efficient analog-domain compression. The architecture achieves a 4-8x reduction in output data rate while preserving low-loss full-array information. The MVM SAR ADC executes passive and accurate MVM using user-defined programmable ternary weights. Two signal reconstruction methods are implemented: (1) an optimization approach using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, and (2) a learning-based approach employing implicit neural representation. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the chip achieves an ADC's SNDR of 57.5 dB at 20.41 MS/s, with an AFE input-referred noise of 3.5 nV/sqrt(Hz). MVM linearity measurements show R^2 > 0.999 across a wide range of weights and input amplitudes.

The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data-level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u4f20\u611f\u5668-AI-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6280\u672f\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u9886\u57df\uff1a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\u5eb7\u590d\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u3002\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u9886\u57df\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u95ed\u73af\u4f20\u611f\u5668-AI-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\uff08IMU\u3001EMG\u3001EEG\u7b49\uff09\u6301\u7eed\u6307\u5bfc\u60a3\u8005\u3001\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3001LLM\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u4ee5\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u62a4\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u8fdbAI\u6280\u672f\u6784\u5efa\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Therefore, Spectral Deconvolution imaging (SDI) methods based on PSF engineering have been proposed to achieve high-fidelity compact CSI design recently. However, the composite convolution-integration operations of SDI render the normal-equation coefficient matrix scene-dependent, which hampers the efficient exploitation of imaging priors and poses challenges for accurate reconstruction. To tackle the inherent data-dependent operators in SDI, we introduce a Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Aggregation Unfolding Framework (HSFAUF). By decomposing subproblems and projecting them into the frequency domain, HSFAUF transforms nonlinear processes into linear mappings, thereby enabling efficient solutions. Furthermore, to integrate spatial-spectral priors during iterative refinement, we propose a Spatial-Frequency Aggregation Transformer (SFAT), which explicitly aggregates information across spatial and frequency domains.

While beamfocusing has been theoretically established as a key feature of large-aperture RISs, its practical realization has remained unexplored. We derive new analytical expressions for the array gain achieved with a $b$-bit RIS in near-field line-of-sight scenarios, characterizing both the finite depth and angular width of the focal region. The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that near-field beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation.

However, their adoption is challenged by the rapid variability of wireless channels, which makes pre-trained static DNN-based receivers ineffective, and by the latency and computational burden of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based learning. In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates. Simulations with practical communication channels demonstrate that our proposed online learning framework can maintain a low error rate with markedly reduced update latency and increased robustness to channel dynamics as compared to traditional gradient descent based method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94DNN\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u66f4\u65b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "DNN\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9759\u6001DNN\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebfSGD\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u9002\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u591a\u8f6eSGD\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316DNN\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8bef\u7801\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u66f4\u65b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aDNN\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Existing public datasets, such as CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts. There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using Olympus 170 and Pentax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate baseline performance, we provide benchmark results for classification using VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises 1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation. Performance was lower compared to curated datasets, reflecting the real-world difficulty of images with artifacts and variable quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86BUET\u606f\u8089\u6570\u636e\u96c6(BPD)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u606f\u8089\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u65e0\u606f\u8089\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u80a0\u606f\u8089\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Olympus 170\u548cPentax i-Scan\u7cfb\u5217\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6536\u96c6\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u955c\u9762\u9ad8\u5149\u3001\u7caa\u4fbf\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8840\u6db2\u548c\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528VGG16\u3001ResNet50\u548cInceptionV3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528UNet\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea164\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u76841,288\u5f20\u606f\u8089\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6765\u81ea31\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u76841,657\u5f20\u65e0\u606f\u8089\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe90.8%(VGG16)\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u6700\u9ad8Dice\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.64(InceptionV4-UNet)\u3002\u4e0e\u7b5b\u9009\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "BPD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53cd\u6620\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u606f\u8089\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We propose four axioms and rigorously prove that the family of pairwise rank-Copulas is the minimal sufficient representation for minimal structural semantics. Based on this, we construct a semantic distortion metric, centered on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We then establish the core theoretical boundaries of the framework: sample complexity bounds; rate-distortion bounds; an end-to-end Service Level Agreements theorem; and a semantic source-channel separation theorem, which provides a provable Quality of Service guarantee. Finally, we validate our framework through decoupled experiments, empirically demonstrating that our core metric strictly adheres to our foundational axioms while standard perceptual metrics fail to do so.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6210\u5bf9\u79e9Copula\u65cf\u662f\u8868\u793a\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eJensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7387\u5931\u771f\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\u7b49\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f20\u8f93\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u6210\u5bf9\u79e9Copula\u65cf\u662f\u8868\u793a\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eJensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7387\u5931\u771f\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\u7b49\u7ea7\u534f\u8bae\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u6838\u5fc3\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u57fa\u7840\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u7a0b\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance. Then, we propose a two-stage positioning method starting with a (i) MCRB-based weighted orbit calibration, followed by (ii) least-squares user positioning using the corrected orbit. The MCRB analysis indicates that orbital errors can induce kilometer-level position biases. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimator can considerably enhance the positioning accuracy relative to the orbit-mismatched baseline, yielding errors on the order of a few meters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684LEO\u536b\u661f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eMCRB\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8f68\u9053\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7c73\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u8f68\u9053\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u5730\u7403\u975e\u7403\u9762\u6027\u7684LEO\u8f68\u9053\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6355\u83b7\u5feb\u6162\u65f6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u591a\u5f84\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884cMCRB\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eMCRB\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8f68\u9053\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "MCRB\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u5343\u7c73\u7ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f68\u9053\u5931\u914d\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u7c73\u7ea7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9LEO\u536b\u661f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Accurate lesion detection remains challenging due to the need to identify multiple lesions of varying sizes. In this study, we investigate the effect of adding anatomy prior information to deep learning-based lesion detection models. In particular, we add organ segmentation masks from the TotalSegmentator tool as auxiliary inputs to provide anatomical context to nnDetection, which is the state-of-the-art for lesion detection, and Swin Transformer. The latter is trained in two stages that combine self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The method is tested in the AutoPET and Karolinska lymphoma datasets. The results indicate that the inclusion of anatomical priors substantially improves the detection performance within the nnDetection framework, while it has almost no impact on the performance of the vision transformer. Moreover, we observe that Swin Transformer does not offer clear advantages over conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders used in nnDetection.

Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-RIS can significantly improve covert performance, particularly in angular-overlap scenarios where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation. These findings further highlight the effectiveness of FD-RIS in enhancing CC robustness under challenging spatial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u8f85\u52a9\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u63a7RIS\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb-\u89d2\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u853d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u8f85\u52a9\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u9891\u63a7RIS\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb-\u89d2\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FD-RIS\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5ef6\u6280\u672f\u63a7\u5236\u8c10\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u770b\u5b88\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u5ef6\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u9891\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eFD-RIS\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u853d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6FD-RIS\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FD-RIS\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76f2\u533a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A detailed PSI-enabled reconstruction model is formulated using various forms of PSI. The hierarchical block orthogonal matching pursuit with PSI (HiBOMP-P) algorithm is designed in a recursive form to reliably recover hierarchically block-sparse signals. We derive exact recovery conditions (ERCs) measured by the mutual incoherence property (MIP), wherein hierarchical MIP concepts are proposed, and further develop reconstructible sparsity levels to reveal sufficient conditions for ERCs. Leveraging these MIP analyses, we present several extended insights, including reliable recovery conditions in noisy scenarios and the optimal hierarchical structure for cases where sparsity is not equal to zero.

However, GFlowNet-based approaches assume static environments, limiting their applicability in mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions. The approach requires no labeled data, employing a pseudo-supervised consistency objective derived from the learned reward by GFlowNet and the actual sum-rate reward of the TM-IRS system.

Clinically, BPE is qualitatively assessed by radiologists, but quantitative BPE measures offer potential for more precise risk evaluation. This study evaluated an existing open-source, fully-automated deep learning-based (DL-based) method for segmenting fibroglandular tissue (FGT) to quantify BPE and compared it to a semi-automated fuzzy c-means method. Using breast MRI examinations from 100 women, we evaluated segmentation agreement, concordance across quantitative BPE metrics, and associations with qualitative BPE. The quality of FGT segmentations from both methods was scored by a radiologist. While the DL-based and semi-automated methods showed good agreement for quantitative BPE measurements, DL-based measures more strongly correlated with qualitative BPE assessments and DL-based segmentations were scored as higher quality by the radiologist.

Yet, they frequently fail to preserve the critical anatomical details needed for diagnostic tasks. This fundamental limitation hinders their clinical applicability despite their high metric scores. We propose a novel task-adaptive reconstruction framework that addresses this gap by incorporating a frozen pre-trained task network as a regularization term in the reconstruction loss function. Unlike existing joint-training approaches that simultaneously optimize both reconstruction and task networks, and risk diverging from satisfactory reconstructions, our method leverages a pre-trained task model to guide reconstruction training while still maintaining diagnostic quality. We validate our framework on a liver and liver tumor segmentation task. Our task-adaptive models achieve Dice scores up to 0.707, approaching the performance of full-dose scans (0.874), and substantially outperforming joint-training approaches (0.331) and traditional reconstruction methods (0.626). Critically, our framework can be integrated into any existing deep learning-based reconstruction model through simple loss function modification, enabling widespread adoption for task-adaptive optimization in clinical practice.

Recognizing the performance degradation caused by environmental blockers, the system introduces a joint waveform design that ensures robust operation under varying channel conditions. A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate. These results corroborate the system's ability to adapt and optimize joint sensing-communication performance in practical deployment environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u963b\u585e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u8f7d\u6ce2ISAC-NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u53476G\u7f51\u7edc\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u963b\u585e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73af\u5883\u963b\u585e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8fd0\u884c", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8054\u5408\u6ce2\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u5207\u6362\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f53\u4e3bLOS\u94fe\u8def\u88ab\u963b\u585e\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3NLOS\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u8def\u7531\u901a\u4fe1", "result": "\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u585e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u572815dB SNR\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe400%\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u901f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d20%", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u5408\u611f\u77e5-\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd"}}

Nonetheless, the characteristics of non-professional acquisition and the subsequent transcoding of UGC video on sharing platforms present significant challenges for NR-VQA. Although NR-VQA models attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective scores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of fine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these challenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the semantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video metadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted from inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in generating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been designed to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic alignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These multimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality scores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving improved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations. Our method achieves the best performance in terms of average rank and linear correlation (SRCC: 0.928, PLCC: 0.938) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In an attempt to address the global digital divide problem, this paper explores a multi-high-altitude platform system (HAPS)-ground integrated network, in which multiple HAPSs collaborate with ground base stations (BSs) to enhance the users' quality of service on the ground to achieve the highly sought-after digital equity. To this end, this paper considers maximizing both the network-wide weighted sum rate function and the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function subject to the same system level constraints. More specifically, the paper tackles the two different optimization problems so as to balance throughput and fairness, by accounting for the individual HAPS payload connectivity constraints, HAPS and BS distinct power limitations, and per-user rate requirements. This paper solves the considered problems using techniques from optimization theory by adopting a generalized assignment problem (GAP)-based methodology to determine the user association variables, jointly with successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithms for optimizing the corresponding beamforming vectors. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithms is their amenability for distributed implementation across the multiple HAPSs and BSs.

These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack.

In particular, the conventional MGM beamforming requires substantial computational complexity and feedback (or pilot) overhead for acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while simultaneous interference management and multicast beamforming optimization across multi-group inevitably incurs a significant rate loss. To address this, we propose a CSIT-free MGM (CF-MGM) transmission that eliminates the need for a complex CSIT acquisition. A deterministic CSIT-free precoding and proposed closed-form power allocation based on max-min fairness (MMF) allow each user to detect the common multicast stream completely canceling the inter-group interference with a significantly low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed CF-MGM for the achievable rate and increase of users in a group outperforming the existing CSIT-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u514dCSIT\u7684\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u8f7d\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u83b7\u53d6CSIT\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ba1\u7406\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027CSIT-free\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u7ec4\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\u516c\u5171\u591a\u64ad\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0CF-MGM\u5728\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u7528\u6237\u589e\u52a0\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eCSIT\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CF-MGM\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7ec4\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2dCSIT\u83b7\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u7ba1\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u3002"}}

This paper derives the closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint velocity estimation using a modular linear array (MLA) within a predictive-beamforming framework.

We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the achievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the same transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA).

We derive a closed-form lower bound on the warden's average minimum detection error probability which is then used to define the covert constraint. Building on this, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV's 3D placement, its power allocation, and the satellite's transmit power to maximize the system's covert rate.

Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy.

The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SaPINNs\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u72b6\u6001-\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728El Centro\u5730\u9707\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPINNs\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5730\u9707\u3001\u98ce\u66b4\u7b49\u81ea\u7136\u5371\u5bb3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u77ac\u6001\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9891\u8c31\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u77e5\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Deep Ensemble\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPINNs\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6062\u590d\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "SaPINNs\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u5371\u5bb3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse \u03bc-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd1\u573a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u573a\u6ce2\u524d\u7531\u4e8e\u7403\u9762\u6ce2\u4f20\u64ad\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a5\u6536\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316RBF\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9006\u03bc\u5f8b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06RBF\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684Huberized\u7559\u4e00\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7RBF\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u8865\u5168\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd1\u573a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fMIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u672a\u6765\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5f80\u8fd4\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u94fe\u8def\u5e72\u6270\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u89d2\u8272\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5728DLI\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u4fe1\u9053\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u5931\u914d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86DLI\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u75281\u4f4dADC\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236DLI\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u4f7f\u75288\u4f4dADC\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u53cd\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6ADC\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6ADC\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Dijkstra\u548cA*\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u7ebf\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8fde\u63a5\u6765\u5378\u8f7d\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u7a7f\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a5\u5165\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5207\u6362\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4fee\u6539\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Dijkstra\u548cA*\uff09\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6210\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u8def\u5f84\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\u8d28\u91cf\u7eb3\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\\% in a multipath-rich scene.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable tools for logistics collection within LAE systems, offering the ability to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and improve operational efficiency. However, logistics collection tasks involve UAVs flying through complex three-dimensional (3D) environments while avoiding obstacles, where traditional UAV trajectory design methods,typically developed under free-space conditions without explicitly accounting for obstacles, are not applicable. This paper presents, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods to minimize the total collection time. Specifically, the LKH algorithm determines the optimal order of item collection, while the DDPG algorithm designs the flight trajectory between collection points. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed LKH-DDPG algorithm significantly reduces collection time by approximately 49 percent compared to baseline approaches, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing UAV trajectories and enhancing operational efficiency for logistics collection tasks in the LAE paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408LKH\u548cDDPG\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u6d41\u6536\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea649%\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7269\u6d41\u6536\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u907f\u969c\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH)\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cLKH\u786e\u5b9a\u7269\u54c1\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u987a\u5e8f\uff0cDDPG\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6536\u96c6\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684LKH-DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea649%\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7269\u6d41\u6536\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based procedure not only achieves superior spectral efficiency but also scales favorably with the number of antennas and UEs compared to state-of-the-art SCA-based algorithms, making it a practical tool for next-generation multicast systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eADMM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3cell-free\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u516c\u5e73(MMF)\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf(QoS)\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u9664\u7b56\u7565\u5728ADMM\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u79e91\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b(SDR)\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c(SCA)\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9a7b\u70b9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u64ad\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5(ADMM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u5b9a\u677e\u5f1b\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u9664\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728ADMM\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u5f97\u79e91\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ADMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684SCA\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5ADMM\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u591a\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u3002"}}

While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI.
