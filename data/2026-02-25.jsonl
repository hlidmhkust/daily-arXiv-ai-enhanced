However, the inherent sparsity of tumors and their morphological diversity lead to obvious heterogeneity across regions, posing significant challenges in aggregating high-quality and discriminative representations. To address this, we introduce a novel concept of anchor instance (AI), a compact subset of instances that are representative within their regions (local) and discriminative at the bag (global) level. These AIs act as semantic references to guide interactions across regions, correcting non-discriminative patterns while preserving regional diversity. Specifically, we propose a dual-level anchor mining (DAM) module to \\textbf{select} AIs from massive instances, where the most informative AI in each region is extracted by assessing its similarity to both local and global embeddings. Furthermore, to ensure completeness and diversity, we devise an anchor-guided region correction (ARC) module that explores the complementary information from all regions to \\textbf{correct} each regional representation. Building upon DAM and ARC, we develop a concise yet effective framework, AINet, which employs a simple predictor and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with substantially fewer FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, both DAM and ARC are modular and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MIL frameworks, consistently improving their performance."}

Materials and Methods: This retrospective multi-dataset study developed nnU-Net models on BraTS 2021 (n=848) and externally tested them on UPenn-GBM glioblastoma MRI (n=403; 2006-2018; age 18-89 years; 60% male). Models were trained with no dropout or targeted T2-FLAIR dropout (probability rate r=0.35 or 0.50) by replacing only the T2-FLAIR channel with zeros. Inference used T2-FLAIR-present and T2-FLAIR-absent scenarios (T2-FLAIR set to zero). The primary endpoint was Dice similarity coefficient (DSC); secondary endpoints were 95th percentile Hausdorff distance and Bland-Altman whole-tumor volume bias. Equivalence was assessed with two one-sided tests using +/-1.5 DSC percentage points, and noninferiority versus HD-GLIO used a -1.5-point margin. Results: With T2-FLAIR present, median overall DSC was 94.8% (interquartile range, 90.0%-97.1%) with dropout and 95.0% (interquartile range, 90.3%-97.1%) without dropout (equivalence supported, p<0.001). With T2-FLAIR absent, median overall DSC improved from 81.0% (interquartile range, 75.1%-86.4%) without dropout to 93.4% (interquartile range, 89.1%-96.2%) with dropout (r=0.35); edema DSC improved from 14.0% to 87.0%, edema 95th percentile Hausdorff distance improved from 22.44 mm to 2.45 mm, and whole-tumor volume bias improved from -45.6 mL to 0.83 mL. Dropout was noninferior to HD-GLIO under T2-FLAIR-present (all p<0.001). Conclusion: Targeted T2-FLAIR dropout preserved segmentation performance when T2-FLAIR was available and reduced segmentation error and whole-tumor volume bias when T2-FLAIR was absent."}

This paper introduces a progressive pipeline integrating DEFOM-Stereo foundation-model disparity estimation, SAM3 instance segmentation, and multi-stage depth optimization to deliver robust per-branch point clouds. Starting from a naive baseline, we systematically identify and resolve three error families through successive refinements. Mask boundary contamination is first addressed through morphological erosion and subsequently refined via a skeleton-preserving variant to safeguard thin-branch topology. Segmentation inaccuracy is then mitigated using LAB-space Mahalanobis color validation coupled with cross-branch overlap arbitration. Finally, depth noise - the most persistent error source - is initially reduced by outlier removal and median filtering, before being superseded by a robust five-stage scheme comprising MAD global detection, spatial density consensus, local MAD filtering, RGB-guided filtering, and adaptive bilateral filtering. Evaluated on 1920x1080 stereo imagery of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) acquired with a ZED Mini camera (63 mm baseline) from a UAV in Canterbury, New Zealand, the proposed pipeline reduces the average per-branch depth standard deviation by 82% while retaining edge fidelity. The result is geometrically coherent 3D point clouds suitable for autonomous pruning tool positioning. All code and processed data are publicly released to facilitate further UAV forestry research."}

In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted.

Full version of a work prepared for submission to IEEE", "summary": "In practical Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems, symbol detection remains challenging due to severe inter-user interference and sensitivity to Channel State Information (CSI) uncertainty. In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples."}

We prove an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making $2$ queries (even adaptively) over the binary alphabet.

Combined with the results of Ben-Sasson et al., our result exhibits a ``phase-transition''-type behavior on the codeword length for some constant-query complexity. We achieve these lower bounds via a transformation of RLDCs to standard Hamming LDCs, using a careful analysis of restrictions of message bits that fix codeword bits."}

In this work, we use a benchmark radar dataset to reimplement and assess three recent denoising and preprocessing techniques: adaptive preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and entropy-based denoising. To illustrate the shortcomings of conventional metrics in low-SNR regimes, we evaluate performance using both perceptual image quality measures and standard error-based metrics. We additionally propose a novel framework for static activity recognition using range-angle feature maps to expand HAR beyond dynamic activities.

Quantifying low-concentration metabolites such as GABA ($γ$-aminobutyric acid) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral overlap. We investigate and validate deep learning for quantifying complex, low-SNR, overlapping signals from MEGA-PRESS spectra, devise a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Y-shaped autoencoder (YAE), and select the best models via Bayesian optimisation on 10,000 simulated spectra from slice-profile-aware MEGA-PRESS simulations. The selected models are trained on 100,000 simulated spectra. We validate their performance on 144 spectra from 112 experimental phantoms containing five metabolites of interest (GABA, Glu, Gln, NAA, Cr) with known ground truth concentrations across solution and gel series acquired at 3 T under varied bandwidths and implementations. These models are further assessed against the widely used LCModel quantification tool. On simulations, both models achieve near-perfect agreement (small MAEs; regression slopes $\\approx 1.00$, $R^2 \\approx 1.00$). On experimental phantom data, errors initially increased substantially. However, modelling variable linewidths in the training data significantly reduced this gap. The best augmented deep learning models achieved a mean MAE for GABA over all phantom spectra of 0.151 (YAE) and 0.160 (FCNN) in max-normalised relative concentrations, outperforming the conventional baseline LCModel (0.220). A sim-to-real gap remains, but physics-informed data augmentation substantially reduced it. Phantom ground truth is needed to judge whether a method will perform reliably on real data."}

This paper proposes a zero-overhead online and continual learning framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) neural receivers that directly detect the soft bits of received signals. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods that rely on dedicated training intervals or full resource grids, our approach leverages existing demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to simultaneously enable signal demodulation and model adaptation. We introduce three pilot designs: fully randomized, hybrid, and additional pilots that flexibly support joint demodulation and learning. To accommodate these pilot designs, we develop two receiver architectures: (i) a parallel design that separates inference and fine-tuning for uninterrupted operation, and (ii) a forward-pass reusing design that reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively tracks both slow and fast channel distribution variations without additional overhead, service interruption, or catastrophic performance degradation under distribution shift."}

Vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $δ< Δ$, additive errors of magnitude at most $δ$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $Δ$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $Δ/δ$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$. Moreover, this characterization is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation when the columns of the generator matrix of $C$ all have the same $L_2$ norm. Through examples of several code families, it is demonstrated how the results herein can be used to compute the height profile explicitly."}

Under the control of a central processing unit (CPU), multiple access points (APs) collaboratively perform multistatic sensing while providing communication service in a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Achieving high sensing accuracy requires the collection of global sensing information at the CPU, which can lead to significant fronthaul signaling overhead due to the feedback of the sensing signals from each AP. To tackle this issue, we propose a collaborative processing scheme in which the APs locally compress and quantize the received sensing signals before forwarding them to the CPU. The CPU then aggregates the information from all APs to estimate the location and velocity of the targets. We develop a distributed vector-quantized variational autoencoder (D-VQVAE) to enable an end-to-end implementation of this scheme. D-VQVAE consists of distributed encoders at the APs to locally encode the received sensing signals, codebooks for quantizing the encoded results, and a decoder at the CPU for location and velocity estimation. It effectively reduces the amount of data transmitted from each AP to the CPU while maintaining a high sensing accuracy. We employ a collaborative learning-assisted scheme to train D-VQVAE in an end-to-end manner. Simulation results show that the proposed D-VQVAE network outperforms the baseline schemes in sensing accuracy and reduces fronthaul signaling overhead by 99% when compared with the centralized sensing approach."}

Pulse compression gain enhances the system's long-range sensing capability, while OFDM ensures the system's high-speed data transmission capability. Meanwhile, the LFM signal is utilized as superimposed pilot for channel estimation, which has higher time-frequency resource utilization and stronger real-time performance compared to orthogonal pilots. We present an accurate parameter estimation method of multi-path sensing signal for reconstructing and interference cancellation in communication users. Additionally, a cyclic maximum likelihood method is introduced for channel estimation and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of channel estimation is derived.

We first reveal that within each BD-RIS group, the cascaded channel associated with one user antenna and one BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other user antenna and BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-BS channel. This insight drastically reduces the dimensionality of the channel estimation problem. Building on this property, we propose an efficient two-phase channel estimation protocol. In the first phase, the reference cascaded channels for all groups are estimated in parallel based on common received signals while determining the scaling coefficients for a single reference antenna. In the second phase, the scaling coefficients for all remaining user antennas are estimated.

We further develop a provable, computationally efficient reconstruction algorithm that recovers the 3-D signal by successively solving a sequence of well-conditioned linear systems. The algorithm is validated through extensive numerical experiments. Our results provide a principled and tractable framework for high-noise 3-D orbit recovery, with potential relevance to cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography modeling, where molecules are observed in unknown orientations."}

However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN."}

FGFRFT reduces the complexity of generating transform matrices to $O(2LN^2)$ while preserving differentiability, thereby enabling adaptive order learning.

In addition, we derive the analytical power spectral density of AFDM and evaluate its spectral characteristics in comparison with other multicarrier schemes, considering the impact of realistic truncated pulse-shaping. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the CT model to phase noise, carrier frequency offset, and sampling jitter, providing a theoretical analysis of communication performance. Finally, we derive closed-form Cramér-Rao bounds for channel parameter estimation, showing that the chirped modulation peculiar of AFDM increases the estimation variance but enables the resolution of Doppler ambiguities.

In this study, we introduce a novel biologically inspired protection system based on neuromorphic principles, where each distributed energy resource (DER) functions as a simple neuron. These neurons process local changes in voltage, current signals, and converting them into spike patterns that represent the severity of disturbances. Just as neurons communicate via synapses in biological systems, we exploit transmission cables to coordinate between DERs, enabling them to share information and respond to faults collectively. Fault detection and circuit breaker activation are driven by a First-To-Spike (FTTS) mechanism, similar to the concept of traveling wave protection, but without needing GPS synchronization or communication links. A key innovation is the ability to use the timing of spikes to locally determine the nature of a fault, offering an intelligent, adaptive response to disturbances. Performance shows tripping latency of 10-58 ms, surpassing conventional relays and even traveling-wave methods (60 ms), while maintaining detection accuracy above 98% and spatial selectivity over 97%, enabling real-time, communication-free, scalable protection for plug-and-play microgrids."}

Full version of a work prepared for submission to IEEE", "summary": "In practical Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems, symbol detection remains challenging due to severe inter-user interference and sensitivity to Channel State Information (CSI) uncertainty. In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples."}

This paper presents a joint timing recovery and data detection framework for integrate-and-fire time encoding receivers.

This letter addresses this issue for group-connected BDRIS aided uplink communication from multiple multi-antenna users to one multi-antenna base station (BS). We first reveal that within each BD-RIS group, the cascaded channel associated with one user antenna and one BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other user antenna and BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-BS channel. This insight drastically reduces the dimensionality of the channel estimation problem. Building on this property, we propose an efficient two-phase channel estimation protocol. In the first phase, the reference cascaded channels for all groups are estimated in parallel based on common received signals while determining the scaling coefficients for a single reference antenna. In the second phase, the scaling coefficients for all remaining user antennas are estimated. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves substantially lower estimation error with fewer pilot signals compared to state-of-the-art benchmark schemes."}

We show that both DMHSA models maintain high estimation accuracy, with the root mean squared error typically below 1 dB with priority-queuing-based scheduled users.

In this letter, we propose two efficient solvers: 1) a coordinate-transformation-based kernel approximation that preserves the operator structure while alleviating discretization demands, and 2) a direct lower-upper (LU)-based solver that stably handles the Nyström-discretized system. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to conventional methods, with the LU-based solver emerging as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale CAPA optimization via offline factorization."}

Although CCT information is generally available for commercial lamps, CRI is commonly not reported. In addition, devices measuring these parameters are difficult to access as they require a spectrophotometer, a commonly expensive device. In this context, the present work designs and builds a meter in detail, from the structural part of the equipment, interface with sensors, and the calculation to the compensation algorithms implementation, aiming to build the dedicated functionalities of a spectrophotometer, which is designed without the use of optical lenses. In addition to simplifying the device, this approach allows measurements free from dispersions caused by chromatic aberrations typical of optical lenses. The prototype obtained proved to be effective, capturing the spectral power distributions of various light sources and calculating their CCT and CRI."}
