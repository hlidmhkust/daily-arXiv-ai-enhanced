Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a disruptive
technology for future wireless networks. To investigate their capabilities, we
study the sum rate maximization problem in an SIM-based multiuser (MU)
multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system. A vast majority of pioneer
studies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing
alternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and
SIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches
suffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,
when the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \emph{fixed SIM
thickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains
can still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed
method in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design
guidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase
shifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first
yields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB
first; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are
gradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their
scalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better
performance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing
solutions. Based on these customizations, the proposed method achieves a higher
achievable sum rate (ASR) of up to $\ensuremath{115.53\%}$, compared to
benchmark schemes for the scenarios under consideration.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology holds immense potential
for increasing the performance of wireless networks. Therefore, RIS is also
regarded as one of the solutions to address communication challenges in
high-mobility scenarios, such as Doppler shift and fast fading. This paper
investigates a high-speed train (HST) multiple-input single-output (MISO)
communication system aided by a RIS. We propose a block coordinate descent
(BCD) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS phase shifts and the transmit
beamforming vectors to maximize the channel gain. Numerical results are
provided to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the
system performance, achieving an average channel gain improvement of 15 dB
compared to traditional schemes. Additionally, the introduction of RIS
eliminates outage probability and improves key performance metrics such as
achievable rate, channel capacity, and bit error rate (BER). These findings
highlight the critical role of RIS in enhancing HST communication systems.

Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching
a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of
mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed
scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in
the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained
attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of
signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant
elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of
incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and
its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is
imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be
analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint.
Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed
in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization
for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical
results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such
as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

Method: 提出一种RIS配置方法，能够为广带信号提供频率选择性的信号反射

Result: 方法能够有效解决广带信号反射的带宽限制问题

Conclusion: 通过频率选择性反射方法，RIS技术可以更好地适应下一代通信系统的广带需求

Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered
in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By
establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by
reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal
reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth
restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully
considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the
next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a
RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection
for wideband signals.

### [5] [On the Compromise Between Performance and Efficiency in RIS-aided Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15599)
*P. H. C. de Souza,M. Khazaee,L. L. Mendes*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: STAR-RIS技术通过同时传输和反射信号，解决了传统RIS系统的空间覆盖和信号放大限制，能够提升无线通信系统的覆盖范围、能效和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RIS系统受限于仅反射功能，限制了空间覆盖和信号放大潜力。需要一种能够同时传输和反射信号的新型智能表面技术来突破这些限制。

Method: 采用同时传输和反射的可重构智能表面（STAR-RIS）技术，通过其双重功能特性，同时处理传输和反射信号。

Conclusion: STAR-RIS技术代表了无线通信系统的新范式，通过其独特的双功能特性，为解决传统RIS系统的局限性提供了有效解决方案，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology for metasurfaces is
ushering in a new paradigm for wireless communication systems. It provides an
accessible way for controlling the interaction between electromagnetic waves
with the propagation medium. One particularly important aspect is the
configuration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective
of the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that
maximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed
for tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far
less reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration
overhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift
in high-mobility communication systems. Despite not being its usual primary
goal, results have also demonstrated that the RIS can compensate for the
Doppler shift at a small cost in performance. However, the typical
reflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and
signal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual
functionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently. It can be
shown that the STAR-RIS can augment coverage, energy efficiency, and latency
reduction, while enhancing sum-rate and physical-layer security across several
wireless contexts.

*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Saif Khan Mohammed,Ronny Hadani,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Zak-OTFS调制方案用于雷达感知，通过离散海森堡-外尔群和辛变换设计波形，将传统雷达信号处理复杂度从O(B²T²)降低到O(BT log T)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统连续雷达信号处理复杂度高，需要寻找更高效的雷达波形设计和处理方法。

Method: 在延迟-多普勒域形成雷达波形，通过匹配滤波和相关处理，利用离散海森堡-外尔群和辛变换进行波形设计和模糊表面整形。

Result: 实现了复杂度从O(B²T²)到O(BT log T)的显著降低，并能定义具有小峰均功率比的最优雷达波形库。

Conclusion: 基于离散群和辛变换的方法为雷达波形设计提供了高效的新途径，大幅降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler
(DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception,
then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same
architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$
where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is
$\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in
the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return,
then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This
produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity
function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler
shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely
studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of
waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from
the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the
discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of
the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity
surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal
processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this
complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to
be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete
Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables
defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power
ratios.

Abstract: The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is revolutionizing industrial
processes by facilitating massive machine-type communications among countless
interconnected devices. To efficiently handle the resulting large-scale and
sporadic traffic, grant-free random access protocols-especially coded random
access (CRA)-have emerged as scalable and reliable solutions. At the same time,
advancements in wireless hardware, including extremely large-scale MIMO arrays
and high-frequency communication (e.g., mmWave, Terahertz), are pushing network
operations into the near-field propagation regime, allowing for dense
connectivity and enhanced spatial multiplexing. This paper proposes an
innovative approach that combines near-field spatial multiplexing with the
interference mitigation capabilities of CRA, utilizing an extremely large
aperture array at the access point. This integration improves reliability and
reduces access latency, offering a robust framework for IIoT connectivity in
next-generation 6G networks.

*Masoud Nateghi,Reza Sameni*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本研究分析了示波法血压测量的系统误差来源，提出基于最小二乘和最大似然估计的统计校正方法，通过多测量平均和先验知识整合来提高非侵入性血压监测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 示波法作为标准的无创袖带血压测量方法存在系统误差，可能影响临床准确性。研究旨在识别这些误差来源（主要是示波法自身局限性和呼吸引起的波动），并开发校正方法来提高测量精度。

Method: 使用MIMIC数据库的血压波形数据，提出基于估计理论的框架，采用最小二乘(LS)和最大似然(ML)方法对单次和重复血压测量进行校正。LS支持传统的多测量平均协议，ML方法则整合测量误差的先验知识。

Result: 示波法倾向于低估收缩压和高估舒张压，呼吸引入的周期性变化进一步降低测量精度。统计结果表明，利用多个读数的统计先验可以显著提高非侵入性血压监测的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的统计校正框架能有效减轻示波法血压测量的系统误差，对改善心血管疾病诊断和治疗具有潜在重要意义，特别是最大似然方法通过整合先验知识提供了更好的性能。

Abstract: Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood
pressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact
clinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these
errors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and
respiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC
database. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate
diastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further
degrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an
estimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum
likelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP
measurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging
protocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement
errors, offering improved performance. Our results demonstrate that leveraging
statistical priors across multiple readings can enhance the accuracy of
non-invasive BP monitoring, with potential implications for improving
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个集成了感知、通信和计算的空中联邦边缘学习系统，分析了无线感知噪声和空中计算失真对收敛行为的影响，并提出了低复杂度的ISCC算法来协调批量大小控制和资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网和边缘计算的发展，需要在边缘设备上实现高效的机器学习模型训练。传统的联邦学习面临通信瓶颈和资源限制，而集成感知、通信和计算的一体化设计可以提升学习性能，但需要理论分析和优化算法支持。

Method: 采用空中计算技术实现单次模型聚合，理论分析ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL的收敛行为，考虑无线感知噪声和空中计算失真。设计ISCC参数优化算法，交替优化批量大小控制和网络资源分配。

Result: 理论分析表明感知、通信和计算竞争网络资源共同决定收敛速率。提出的ISCC算法能够有效协调批量大小控制和资源分配，在人体运动识别任务中验证了理论分析并提升了学习性能。

Conclusion: ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL系统通过协调感知、通信和计算资源，能够有效提升联邦边缘学习的性能。研究发现设备在获得更大批量数据时应消耗更少的感知功率，且在给定批量大小时最优计算速度是满足延迟约束的最小值。

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,

*Eito Kurihara,Hideki Ochiai*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于非均匀非等概率星座和剪切滤波技术的高容量低PAPR OFDM系统设计，通过优化星座形状和剪切噪声消除技术，在AWGN和频率选急衰落信道上同时实现低峰均比和高谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OFDM系统中高峰均比(PAPR)问题和提高谱效率的需求，传统方法在这两者之间存在争议。

Method: 采用截断高斯分布生成非均匀非等概率(NENU)星座，结合剪切滤波(CAF)技术降低PAPR，并在接收端使用剪切噪声消除(CNC)技术。采用单维PAM调制以降低解映复杂度。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该系统在AWGN和频率选急衰落信道上同时实现了低PAPR和高谱效率，且在PAPR和BER性能方面显著优于单载波对照系统。

Conclusion: 通过NENU星座、CAF和CNC技术的结合，成功实现了高容量低PAPR OFDM系统设计，为高速无线通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and
non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The
proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution,
and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform
constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points
without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since
the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters,
each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the
numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the
constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation
(PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM
receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of
OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate
performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the
receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the
presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of
constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to
simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading
channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system
significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded
BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading
channels.

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion-based foundation models have improved text-to-image
generation, yet most efforts have been limited to low-resolution settings. As
high-resolution image synthesis becomes increasingly essential for various
applications, particularly in medical imaging domains, fine-tuning emerges as a
crucial mechanism for adapting these powerful pre-trained models to
task-specific requirements and data distributions. In this work, we present a
systematic study, examining the impact of various fine-tuning techniques on
image generation quality when scaling to high resolution 512x512 pixels. We
benchmark a diverse set of fine-tuning methods, including full fine-tuning
strategies and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We dissect how different
fine-tuning methods influence key quality metrics, including Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID), Vendi score, and prompt-image alignment. We also
evaluate the utility of generated images in a downstream classification task
under data-scarce conditions, demonstrating that specific fine-tuning
strategies improve both generation fidelity and downstream performance when
synthetic images are used for classifier training and evaluation on real
images. Our code is accessible through the project website -

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于GAN的超分辨率方法在4D Flow MRI中的应用，特别是针对近壁速度恢复问题。通过比较三种对抗损失函数，发现Wasserstein GAN在稳定性和性能方面表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI在临床应用中受限于低空间分辨率和噪声，特别是在近壁速度测量方面。虽然机器学习超分辨率方法有潜力，但近壁速度恢复仍具挑战性。GAN在非医学超分辨率任务中表现出色，但在4D Flow MRI中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 使用患者特异性脑血管硅模型生成合成图像，通过MR真实重建管道。实现专用GAN架构，评估三种对抗损失函数：Vanilla、Relativistic和Wasserstein GAN。

Result: 提出的GAN相比非对抗参考改善了近壁速度恢复（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%）。Wasserstein GAN表现出最佳稳定性和增量改进（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%），在低信噪比条件下也优于生成器基线（vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%）。

Conclusion: GAN-based超分辨率在增强4D Flow MRI方面具有潜力，特别是在具有挑战性的脑血管区域，但需要仔细选择对抗策略以确保训练稳定性。

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的动态MRI采集框架，通过概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，使用保形预测生成置信区间，实现按需自动终止扫描，在保证精度的同时减少扫描时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI加速重建方法使用固定加速因子，要么扫描时间过长，要么图像质量不足，无法为下游临床任务提供可靠的不确定性量化。需要一种能够根据个体需求动态调整扫描时间的自适应方法。

Method: 使用概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过保形预测(conformal prediction)生成量化指标的校准置信区间。在采集过程中迭代采样k-space、更新重建并评估置信区间，当不确定性达到用户预设精度目标时自动终止扫描。

Result: 在膝关节和心脏MRI数据集上验证，相比固定协议减少了扫描时间，同时为最终图像的精度提供了正式的统计保证。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了固定加速因子，实现了患者特异性的采集，在扫描效率和诊断置信度之间取得平衡，是向个性化和资源高效MRI迈进的关键一步。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional

video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency

Abstract: Medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound are essential for accurate diagnosis
and treatment planning in modern healthcare. However, noise contamination
during image acquisition and processing frequently degrades image quality,
obscuring critical diagnostic details and compromising clinical
decision-making. Additionally, enhancement techniques such as histogram
equalization may inadvertently amplify existing noise artifacts, including
salt-and-pepper distortions. This study investigates wavelet transform-based
denoising methods for effective noise mitigation in medical images, with the
primary objective of identifying optimal combinations of threshold values,
decomposition levels, and wavelet types to achieve superior denoising
performance and enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Through systematic evaluation
across various noise conditions, the research demonstrates that the bior6.8
biorthogonal wavelet with universal thresholding at decomposition levels 2-3
consistently achieves optimal denoising performance, providing significant
noise reduction while preserving essential anatomical structures and diagnostic
features critical for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) permits high quality images from
fewer samples that can be collected with a faster scan. Two established methods
for accelerating MRI include parallel imaging and compressed sensing. Two types
of parallel imaging include linear predictability, which assumes that the
Fourier samples are linearly related, and sensitivity encoding, which
incorporates a priori knowledge of the sensitivity maps. In this work, we
combine compressed sensing with both types of parallel imaging using a novel
regularization term: SPIRiT regularization. When combined, the reconstructed
images are improved. We demonstrate results on data of a brain, a knee, and an
ankle.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合激光散射模型生成的高质量2D X光投影作为外部先验，有效充分利用了丰富的HR 2D X光数据，成功克服了传结零样本方法的限制，为3D CT超分辨率提供了一种有效的新方法

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic
cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results
demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they
perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and
they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC
addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC)
layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate
this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding
additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be
readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

Conclusion: 所提出的DECSC框架有效统一了多种特征表示，在深度均衡模型框架下实现了高性能的高光谱图像去噪

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Motivation: 医学影像中观察者间的标注变异性引入了标签不确定性，特别是在肺部超声这种视觉解释主观性强的模态中。传统的绝对真实标签方法无法抓取这种内在的不确定性。

Method: 设计了一种数据标注协议，收集射彩科医生对每个标注区域的信心值。在训练时使用不同信心阈值（60%）来二值化标签，并对比了多种展现不确定性的方法。

Result: 训练时结合信心值能够显著提高分割性能，并优化下游临床任务的表现，包括S/F氧合比估计、S/F比值变化分类和30天再入院预测。高信心阈值（60%）比低阈值（50%）效果更好。

Conclusion: 标签信心值是一个有价值的信号，通过合理利用可以显著提高AI在医学影像中的可靠性和临床应用价值。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at
https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.
