### [1] [Latent Space Single-Pixel Imaging Under Low-Sampling Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03543)
*Chenyu Yuan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出LSSPI框架，将单像素成像迁移到潜在空间，显著提升低采样率下的成像能力，在信噪比、细节重建、计算效率等方面优于传统深度学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单像素成像网络在像素空间操作存在局限，需要创新方法提升低采样率下的成像性能

Method: 将单像素成像迁移到潜在空间，在潜在空间中进行重建和生成任务的深度探索，开发LSSPI框架

Result: 相比传统网络，在相同采样率下重建图像具有更高信噪比和更丰富细节，实现盲去噪和高频信息有效恢复，模型参数效率和重建速度更优

Conclusion: LSSPI是低采样单像素成像应用的理想解决方案，有效推动了单像素成像技术的实际应用

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of deep learning into the field of
single-pixel imaging has garnered significant attention. However, traditional
networks often operate within the pixel space. To address this, we innovatively
migrate single-pixel imaging to the latent space, naming this framework LSSPI
(Latent Space Single-Pixel Imaging). Within the latent space, we conduct
in-depth explorations into both reconstruction and generation tasks for
single-pixel imaging. Notably, this approach significantly enhances imaging
capabilities even under low sampling rate conditions. Compared to conventional
deep learning networks, LSSPI not only reconstructs images with higher
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and richer details under equivalent sampling rates
but also enables blind denoising and effective recovery of high-frequency
information. Furthermore, by migrating single-pixel imaging to the latent
space, LSSPI achieves superior advantages in terms of model parameter
efficiency and reconstruction speed. Its excellent computational efficiency
further positions it as an ideal solution for low-sampling single-pixel imaging
applications, effectively driving the practical implementation of single-pixel
imaging technology.

### [2] [Neural Video Compression with In-Loop Contextual Filtering and Out-of-Loop Reconstruction Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04051)
*Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Yiming Wang,Semih Esenlik,Zhaobin Zhang,Kai Zhang,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了神经视频压缩中的增强滤波技术，提出了基于编码循环内外分类的自适应滤波策略，实现了7.71%的比特率降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索增强滤波技术在神经视频压缩中的应用，解决传统方法中错误传播和自适应应用的问题

Method: 将增强滤波技术分为环内上下文滤波和环外重建增强两类，并引入自适应编码决策策略动态确定滤波应用

Result: 相比最先进的神经视频编解码器，实现了7.71%的比特率降低

Conclusion: 提出的系统化增强滤波方法有效提升了神经视频压缩的编码效率，是该领域的首个系统性研究

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [3] [EHVC: Efficient Hierarchical Reference and Quality Structure for Neural Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04118)
*Junqi Liao,Yaojun Wu,Chaoyi Lin,Zhipin Deng,Li Li,Dong Liu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EHVC是一种高效的层次化神经视频编解码器，通过层次化多参考方案、前瞻策略和分层质量尺度训练策略，解决了参考结构与质量结构不匹配的问题，显著提升了编码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经视频编解码器虽然通过端到端学习展现了优异的编码效率，但在参考结构设计方面关注不足，未能与层次化质量结构对齐，且质量结构仍有优化空间。

Method: 提出EHVC编解码器，包含三个关键创新：1）层次化多参考方案，借鉴传统编解码器设计对齐参考和质量结构；2）前瞻策略利用未来帧的编码器端上下文增强质量结构；3）分层质量尺度与随机质量训练策略稳定推理时的质量结构。

Result: EHVC在性能上显著优于最先进的神经视频编解码器。

Conclusion: EHVC通过系统性地解决参考结构与质量结构的对齐问题，并结合前瞻信息和分层训练策略，实现了神经视频编解码器性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code
will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.

### [4] [Multi-Sensor Fusion for Extended Object Tracking Exploiting Active and Passive Radio Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03686)
*Hong Zhu,Alexander Venus,Erik Leitinger,Klaus Witrisal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种贝叶斯定位方法，融合主动测量和被动雷达测量，通过多传感器概率数据关联处理用户遮挡问题，在遮挡条件下优于传统点目标假设方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无线电设备定位中由于用户自身遮挡LOS链路导致的定位不可靠问题，传统方法忽略用户作为扩展物体的影响

Method: 提出贝叶斯方法融合主动测量（设备与基站）和被动多基地雷达测量（基站间经用户反射），引入多传感器多测量概率数据关联算法，开发针对人体用户的扩展物体模型

Result: 在合成和真实无线电测量上的评估表明，该算法在遮挡和遮挡后条件下优于基于点目标假设的传统PDA方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模用户作为扩展物体并融合多类型测量，显著提高了在LOS链路被部分遮挡情况下的定位精度和鲁棒性

Abstract: Reliable and robust positioning of radio devices remains a challenging task
due to multipath propagation, hardware impairments, and interference from other
radio transmitters. A frequently overlooked but critical factor is the agent
itself, e.g., the user carrying the device, which potentially obstructs
line-of-sight (LOS) links to the base stations (anchors). This paper addresses
the problem of accurate positioning in scenarios where LOS links are partially
blocked by the agent. The agent is modeled as an extended object (EO) that
scatters, attenuates, and blocks radio signals. We propose a Bayesian method
that fuses ``active'' measurements (between device and anchors) with
``passive'' multistatic radar-type measurements (between anchors, reflected by
the EO). To handle measurement origin uncertainty, we introduce an multi-sensor
and multiple-measurement probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm that
jointly fuses all EO-related measurements. Furthermore, we develop an EO model
tailored to agents such as human users, accounting for multiple reflections
scattered off the body surface, and propose a simplified variant for
low-complexity implementation. Evaluation on both synthetic and real radio
measurements demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional
PDA methods based on point target assumptions, particularly during and after
obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) conditions.

### [5] [Sensor placement for sparse force reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03825)
*Jeunghoon Lee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于Gram矩阵的传感器布置策略，用于频域稀疏力重构，通过最小化Gram矩阵非对角能量来优化传感器位置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式传感器布局在力重构精度方面存在不足，需要基于物理洞察的优化方法来提高频域力估计的准确性和鲁棒性

Method: 提出Gram矩阵模态分解方法，发现目标频率附近少数模态主导结构；开发贪心算法选择传感器位置以最小化Gram矩阵非对角能量

Result: 数值模拟和实验验证表明，该方法相比启发式布局能获得更鲁棒和准确的力估计结果

Conclusion: Gram矩阵模态分解为传感器布置提供了物理洞察，基于最小化非对角能量的贪心算法能有效提高频域稀疏力重构精度

Abstract: The present study proposes a Gram-matrix-based sensor placement strategy for
sparse force reconstruction in the frequency domain. A modal decomposition of
the Gram matrix reveals that its structure is dominated by a few modes near the
target frequency, and that each modal contribution reflects the spatial
correlation of the corresponding mode shape. This suggests that placing sensors
near nodal regions where spatial correlation is low can reduce coherence in the
frequency response function (FRF) matrix and improve force reconstruction
accuracy. To translate the physical insight into a practical design framework,
a greedy algorithm is proposed to select sensor locations that minimize the
off-diagonal energy of the Gram matrix. Numerical simulations and experimental
validations demonstrate that the proposed method yields robust and accurate
force estimation, outperforming heuristic sensor layouts.

Conclusion: 该系统虽增加了接收机复杂度，但提供了可扩展框架，支持多通道扩频和标签识别，为黄蜂跟踪和环境监测应用提供了开源解决方案

Abstract: The Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) poses a serious threat to ecosystems and
beekeeping. Locating nests is essential, but usually involves time-consuming
manual triangulation. We present a low-cost, open-source tracking system based
on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The system consists of a lightweight BLE tag and
a software-defined radio (SDR) receiver implemented in GNU Radio. By bypassing
the BLE stack, we embed a custom pseudo-noise (PN) sequence in the uncoded PHY
for correlation-based detection. Using a Yagi antenna and PlutoSDR, the
receiver performs digital beam sweeping to determine the tag's direction. Field
tests show reliable angular resolution at 50m and a communication range up to
360m. While our modulation increases receiver complexity, it enables future
improvements such as multichannel spreading and tag identification. The design
is fully open-source and provides a scalable framework for hornet tracking and
related applications in environmental monitoring.

Method: 提出一种新的近似消息传递(AMP)算法，强化双重稀疏性：前导码的稀疏选择和OTFS信号在延迟-多普勒域的本质稀疏性，设计了新的AMP去噪器

Result: 模拟结果显示该方法实现了稳健的检测性能，且较现有最先进技术获得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: 该研究成功地开发了一种高效的算法来解决OTFS系统中的多重前导码检测问题，为随机访问系统提供了更好的性能

Abstract: This article addresses the problem of multiple preamble detection in random
access systems based on orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signaling. This
challenge is formulated as a structured sparse recovery problem in the complex
domain. To tackle it, the authors propose a new approximate message passing
(AMP) algorithm that enforces double sparsity: the sparse selection of
preambles and the inherent sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler
domain. From an algorithmic standpoint, the non-separable complex sparsity
constraint necessitates a careful derivation and leads to the design of a novel
AMP denoiser. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
robust detection performance and delivers significant gains over
state-of-the-art techniques.

### [8] [Joint Frequency-Space Sparse Reconstruction for DOA Estimation under Coherent Sources and Amplitude-Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03983)
*Yutong Chen,Cong Zhou,Changsheng You,Shuo Shi*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 该方法无需迭代优化，计算复杂度低，能够有效应对相干源和数组错误挑战

Abstract: In this letter, we propose a joint frequency-space sparse reconstruction
method for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, which effectively addresses
the issues arising from the existence of coherent sources and array
amplitude-phase errors. Specifically, by using an auxiliary source with known
angles, we first construct the real steering vectors (RSVs) based on the
spectral peaks of received signals in the frequency domain, which serve as a
complete basis matrix for compensation for amplitude-phase errors. Then, we
leverage the spectral sparsity of snapshot data in the frequency domain and the
spatial sparsity of incident directions to perform the DOA estimation according
to the sparse reconstruction method. The proposed method does not require
iterative optimization, hence exhibiting low computational complexity.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA estimation method achieves
higher estimation accuracy for coherent sources as compared to various
benchmark schemes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIMO语义通信系统假设完美信道矩阵估计，但实际中由于硬件和导频开销限制，信道估计存在误差，影响系统性能

Method: 提出信道矩阵适配器与信道编解码器协作适应不准确的信道状态信息；引入两阶段训练策略和知识蒸馏解决估计信道与真实信道间的一对多病态问题

Result: 在多种数据集上，相比最先进基准方法，HANA-JSCC在各种噪声和估计误差水平下平均性能提升0.40~0.54dB

Conclusion: HANA-JSCC系统能有效应对MIMO系统中的信道估计误差，通过自适应机制和训练策略显著提升语义图像传输性能

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as a new communication paradigm.
To enhance efficiency, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
been further integrated into SemComm systems. However, existing MIMO SemComm
systems assume perfect channel matrix estimation for channel-adaptive joint
source-channel coding, which is impractical due to hardware and pilot overhead
constraints. In this paper, we propose a semantic image transmission system
with channel matrix and channel noise adaptation, named HANA-JSCC, to cope with
channel estimation errors in MIMO systems. We propose a channel matrix adaptor
that collaborates with the channel codec to adapt to misaligned channel state
information, thereby mitigating the impact of estimation errors. Since the
relationship between the estimated channel matrix and true channel matrix is
ill-posed (one-to-many), we further introduce a two-stage training strategy
with knowledge distillation to overcome the convergence difficulties caused by
the ill-posed problem. Comparing with the state-of-the-art benchmarks,
HANA-JSCC achieves $0.40\sim0.54$dB higher average performance across various
noise and estimation error levels in various datasets.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究通过星座整形技术来同时提升正交频分复用(OFDM)集成感知与通信(ISAC)系统的感知和通信性能，提出了理论界限和实用的概率幅度整形方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成感知与通信系统中，感知和通信对调制格式有冲突要求，需要在两者性能之间进行权衡，因此需要寻找能够同时提升两者性能的方法。

Method: 采用基于自动编码器的优化方法，研究几何、概率和联合星座整形，推导了理论上下界，并提出了适用于ISAC的广义概率幅度整形(PAS)方法和低复杂度对数似然比计算。

Result: 星座整形能够实现感知与通信性能的灵活权衡，接近理论上限，显著优于传统调制格式。广义PAS方法结合传统PAS能够以低复杂度接近联合星座整形的性能。

Conclusion: 星座整形是提升ISAC系统性能的有效方法，提出的广义PAS方法具有实际可行性，能够在低复杂度下实现接近最优的性能权衡。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) promises new use cases for
mobile communication systems by reusing the communication signal for radar-like
sensing. However, sensing and communications (S&C) impose conflicting
requirements on the modulation format, resulting in a tradeoff between their
corresponding performance. This paper investigates constellation shaping as a
means to simultaneously improve S&C performance in orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC systems. We begin by deriving how the
transmit symbols affect detection performance and derive theoretical lower and
upper bounds on the maximum achievable information rate under a given sensing
constraint. Using an autoencoder-based optimization, we investigate geometric,
probabilistic, and joint constellation shaping, where joint shaping combines
both approaches, employing both optimal maximum a-posteriori decoding and
practical bit-metric decoding. Our results show that constellation shaping
enables a flexible trade-off between S&C, can approach the derived upper bound,
and significantly outperforms conventional modulation formats. Motivated by its
practical implementation feasibility, we review probabilistic amplitude shaping
(PAS) and propose a generalization tailored to ISAC. For this generalization,
we propose a low-complexity log-likelihood ratio computation with negligible
rate loss. We demonstrate that combining conventional and generalized PAS
enables a flexible and low-complexity tradeoff between S&C, closely approaching
the performance of joint constellation shaping.

### [11] [Reliable Clutter Suppression for Slow-Moving Weak Target Radar Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04309)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于Go分解(Godec)框架的新型杂丛压制方案，解决复杂环境下慢速弱目标检测问题，比传统MTI方法更可靠但耗时更长

Motivation: 复杂环境中强反射体对慢速弱目标的掩蔽效应，传统MTI方法可能会压制目标回波，影响检测性能

Method: 利用距离-速度图在不同雷达扫描中的低秩和稀疏特性，基于Go分解(Godec)框架构建杂丛压制方案

Result: 在存在掩蔽效应时，Godec方案能可靠检测慢速弱目标，但耗时更长；揭示了虚拟报单元数、检测概率和迭代次数之间的权衡关系

Conclusion: 该方案以提高时间复杂度为代价，换取了更高的检测可靠性，为实际应用中的参数设置提供了指导

Abstract: Reliable slow-moving weak target detection in complicated environments is
challenging due to the masking effects from the surrounding strong reflectors.
The traditional Moving Target Indication (MTI) may suppress the echoes from not
only the static interference objects (IOs), but also the desired slow-moving
weak target. According to the low-rank and sparse properties of the
range-velocity maps across different radar scans, a novel clutter suppression
scheme based on the Go decomposition (Godec) framework is proposed in this
paper. The simulation results show that with the existence of masking effects,
the target detection scheme based on Godec clutter suppression can reliably
detect the slow-moving weak target, compared to the traditional MTI-based
scheme. Besides, the time consumption comparison is conducted, demonstrating
that the proposed solution is one that sacrifices time complexity in exchange
for enhanced reliability. Additionally, the tradeoffs among the number of false
alarm cells, the detection probability and the iteration times for convergence
have been revealed, guiding parameter settings of the proposed solution in
practical applications. Experiment validation is also conducted to verify the
proposed solution, providing further insight into the scenarios where the
solution is most applicable.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了无人机群在GNSS拒止环境下的相对定位问题，展示了通信与定位性能之间的相互作用，为集成通信感知系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Relative localization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) denied environments is essential for
emergency rescue and battlefield reconnaissance. Existing methods suffer from
significant localization errors among UAVs due to packet loss and high
computational complexity in large swarms. This paper proposes a
clustering-based framework where the UAVs simultaneously use communication
signals for channel estimation and ranging. Firstly, the spectral clustering is
utilized to divide the UAV swarm into different sub-clusters, where matrix
completion and multidimensional scaling yield high-precision relative
coordinates. Subsequently, a global map is created by the inter-cluster anchor
fusion. A case study of UAV integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) system
is presented, where the Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) is adopted for
ranging and communication. Experimental results show that the proposed method
reduces localization errors in large swarms and loss of range information. It
also explores the impact of signal parameters on communication and
localization, highlighting the interplay between communication and localization
performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分布式MIMO系统的相位同步挑战，为大规模网络提供了可扩展的相位校准方案

Abstract: Reciprocity-based, joint coherent downlink beamforming from multiple access
points (APs) in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with
independent local oscillators (LOs) requires the APs to be periodically
phase-calibrated (a.k.a. phase-synchronized or phase-aligned). Such phase
alignment can be accomplished by bidirectional over-the-air measurements
between the APs. In this paper, we show how such over-the-air measurements can
be integrated into the time-division duplexing (TDD) flow by appropriately
shifting the uplink/downlink switching points of the TDD slot structure,
creating short time segments during which APs can measure on one another. We
also show how this technique scales to large networks. Furthermore, we
analytically characterize the tradeoff between the amount of resources spent on
calibration measurements and the resulting spectral efficiency of the system,
when conjugate beamforming or zero-forcing beamforming is used. The results
demonstrate the feasibility of distributed MIMO with phase-calibration through
over-the-air inter-AP measurements integrated into the TDD flow.

Abstract: This paper studies a novel movable antenna (MA)-enhanced multiuser
multiple-input multiple-output downlink system designed to improve wireless
communication performance. We aim to maximize the average achievable sum rate
through two-timescale optimization exploiting instantaneous channel state
information at the receiver (I-CSIR) for receive antenna position vector (APV)
design and statistical channel state information at the transmitter (S-CSIT)
for transmit APV and covariance matrix design. We first decompose the resulting
stochastic optimization problem into a series of short-term problems and one
long-term problem. Then, a gradient ascent algorithm is proposed to obtain
suboptimal receive APVs for the short-term problems for given I-CSIR samples.
Based on the output of the gradient ascent algorithm, a series of convex
objective/feasibility surrogates for the long-term problem are constructed and
solved utilizing the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation
(CSSCA) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a planar movement mode for the
receive MAs to facilitate efficient antenna movement and the development of a
low-complexity primal-dual decomposition-based stochastic successive convex
approximation (PDD-SSCA) algorithm, which finds Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
solutions almost surely. Our numerical results reveal that, for both the
general and the planar movement modes, the proposed two-timescale MA-enhanced
system design significantly improves the average achievable sum rate and the
feasibility of the formulated problem compared to benchmark schemes.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations play a pivotal role in
sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks by providing global coverage, massive
connections, and huge capacity. In this paper, we present a novel LEO satellite
constellation communication framework, where a reconfigurable intelligent
surface-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle (RIS-UAV) is deployed to improve the
communication quality of multiple terrestrial user equipments (UEs) under the
condition of long distance between satellite and ground. To reduce the overhead
for channel state information (CSI) acquisition with multiple-satellite
collaboration, statistical CSI (sCSI) is utilized in the system. In such a
situation, we first derive an approximated but exact expression for ergodic
rate of each UE. Then, we aim to maximize the minimum approximated UE ergodic
rate by the proposed alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that jointly
optimizes LEO satellite beamforming, RIS phase shift, and UAV trajectory.
Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm in terms of spectrum efficiency over baseline
algorithms.

Motivation: 构建长度接近理论最大值的MDS码，证明与Reed-Solomon码的不等价性，扩展椭圆曲线码的构造框架

Method: 利用椭圆曲线构造MDS码，考虑仿射点支持的除子和多个不同点组成的除子，计算生成矩阵Schur积的秩来证明不等价性

Result: 获得长度约为(q+1+⌊2√q⌋)/2的MDS码，证明这些码与RS码不等价，且不被先前结果覆盖

Conclusion: 新构造的椭圆曲线MDS码在长度和不等价性方面具有优势，展示了已知上界的紧性，为MDS码构造提供了更一般的框架

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new family of MDS codes derived from elliptic
curves. These codes attain lengths close to the theoretical maximum and are
provably inequivalent to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Unlike many previous
constructions that rely on the point at infinity, our approach allows for more
general choices: we consider divisors supported on affine points and divisors
consisting of multiple distinct points. This broader framework enables the
construction of codes with length approximately $(q + 1 + \lfloor 2\sqrt{q}
\rfloor)/2$, further illustrating the tightness of known upper bounds on
elliptic MDS code lengths. A detailed comparison shows that our codes are not
covered by earlier results. Moreover, we show that their inequivalence to RS
codes by explicitly computing the rank of the Schur product of their generator
matrices.
