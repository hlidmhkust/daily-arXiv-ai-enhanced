Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant\nlimitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and\nremote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB\nimages to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible\nto environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model\nstability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel\npipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,\ncompensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine\nmorphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the\nsubtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an\nadaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale\nAdaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both\npatch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based\nHybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)\nmodule is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our\ndepth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different\nevaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,\nrespectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we\nintegrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.\nThis integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,\nachieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u5f62\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GAMA-Net\u7f51\u7edc\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u80cc\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u810a\u67f1\u66f2\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u810a\u67f1\u4fa7\u5f2f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670dRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1GAMA-Net\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PBHA\u6a21\u5757\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0cAMFF\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523078.2%\u300193.6%\u548c97.5%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u810a\u67f1\u5f62\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe97%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8868\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u810a\u67f1\u5f62\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u810a\u67f1\u4fa7\u5f2f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Materials and Methods: A\nretrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based\narchitecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data\ncollected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training\nand optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for\nFL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294\npatients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440\npatients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice\nscore for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence\n(PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for\nperformance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The\nFL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved\nperformance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and\n5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the\naverage performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly\nimproved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the\nindependent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection\nperformance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference\nwas observed for prostate segmentation.
