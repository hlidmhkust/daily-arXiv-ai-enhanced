### [1] [Rapid and Accurate Changepoint Detection of Power System Forced Oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15812)
*Luke Dosiek,Akaash Karn,Frank Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用变点检测(CPD)来估计电力系统数据中强迫振荡起止时间的新方法，通过手动设置惩罚参数显著减少计算时间，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用PELT算法时自动调参导致计算时间长，需要更高效的方法来准确检测强迫振荡的起止时间。

Method: 采用PELT算法但手动提供惩罚参数，减少输入参数数量，提供数据驱动的方法设置最小FO段长度。

Result: 使用minniWECC模型测试，计算时间减少98%，同时保持高估计精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著减少计算时间的同时保持了高精度，为电力系统强迫振荡检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.

*Roman Dolgopolyi,Antonis Chatzipanagiotou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 开发了基于CNN-Transformer架构的EEG情绪分类模型，使用5个电极在91%准确率下识别正、中、负三种情绪状态，比传统模型表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统情绪识别方法在面部表情或语音受限场景下的局限性，为医疗、健康平台提供连续被动情绪监测能力。

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer混合架构，在合并SEED系列数据集（1,455个样本）上训练，仅需5个EEG电极而非传统的62个。

Conclusion: 该模型为可负担的家用EEG设备铺平道路，有望在临床和护理环境中革新心理健康诊断和干预。

Abstract: An advanced emotion classification model was developed using a CNN-Transformer architecture for emotion recognition from EEG brain wave signals, effectively distinguishing among three emotional states, positive, neutral and negative. The model achieved a testing accuracy of 91%, outperforming traditional models such as SVM, DNN, and Logistic Regression. Training was conducted on a custom dataset created by merging data from SEED, SEED-FRA, and SEED-GER repositories, comprising 1,455 samples with EEG recordings labeled according to emotional states. The combined dataset represents one of the largest and most culturally diverse collections available. Additionally, the model allows for the reduction of the requirements of the EEG apparatus, by leveraging only 5 electrodes of the 62. This reduction demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a more affordable consumer-grade EEG headset, thereby enabling accessible, at-home use, while also requiring less computational power. This advancement sets the groundwork for future exploration into mood changes induced by media content consumption, an area that remains underresearched. Integration into medical, wellness, and home-health platforms could enable continuous, passive emotional monitoring, particularly beneficial in clinical or caregiving settings where traditional behavioral cues, such as facial expressions or vocal tone, are diminished, restricted, or difficult to interpret, thus potentially transforming mental health diagnostics and interventions...

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI)-based user equipment (UE) positioning with neural networks -- referred to as neural positioning -- is a promising approach for accurate off-device UE localization. Most existing methods train their neural networks with ground-truth position labels obtained from external reference positioning systems, which requires costly hardware and renders label acquisition difficult in large areas. In this work, we propose a novel neural positioning pipeline that avoids the need for any external reference positioning system. Our approach trains the positioning network only using CSI acquired off-device and relative displacement commands executed on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) robot platforms, such as robotic vacuum cleaners -- such an approach enables inexpensive training of accurate neural positioning functions over large areas. We evaluate our method in three real-world scenarios, ranging from small line-of-sight (LoS) areas to larger non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments, using CSI measurements acquired in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio (NR) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed neural positioning pipeline achieves UE localization accuracies close to state-of-the-art methods that require externally acquired high-precision ground-truth position labels for training.

Abstract: Tightly integrated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications and terrestrial integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are expected to be key novel aspects of the 6G era. Spectrum sharing between satellite and terrestrial cellular networks may, however, cause severe interference. This paper introduces a cooperation framework for integrated coexistence between satellite and terrestrial networks where the terrestrial network also deploys multistatic ISAC. Unlike prior works that assume ideal channel state information (CSI) acquisition, the proposed approach develops a practical structure consisting of pre-optimization and refinement stages that leverages the predictability of satellite CSI. In addition, a co-design of terrestrial beamforming and satellite power allocation utilizing a weighted minimum mean-squared error algorithm is proposed, and a target-radar association method designed for multistatic ISAC is presented. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the performance of these integrated networks. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the overall performance approaches the interference-free benchmark as the number of spot beams and radar receivers increases, demonstrating the feasibility of spectral coexistence between the two networks.

Conclusion: 提出的sigmoid近似和PDD算法为IRS辅助网络中的联合接入控制和功率最小化问题提供了高效且收敛性保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Joint admission control and power minimization are critical challenges in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted networks. Traditional methods often rely on \( l_1 \)-norm approximations and alternating optimization (AO) techniques, which suffer from high computational complexity and lack robust convergence guarantees. To address these limitations, we propose a sigmoid-based approximation of the \( l_0 \)-norm AC indicator, enabling a more efficient and tractable reformulation of the problem. Additionally, we introduce a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and admission control, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. This approach reduces computational complexity and supports distributed implementation. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods by achieving lower power consumption, accommodating more users, and reducing computational time.

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder that is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. While existing diagnostic approaches can roughly classify OSA severity or detect isolated respiratory events, they lack the precision and comprehensiveness required for high resolution, event level diagnosis. Here, we present UT OSANet, a deep learning based model designed as a event level, multi scenario diagnostic tool for OSA. This model facilitates detailed identification of events associated with OSA, including apnea, hypopnea, oxygen desaturation, and arousal. Moreover, the model employs flexibly adjustable input modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG), airflow, and SpO 2. It utilizes a random masked modality combination training strategy, allowing it to comprehend cross-modal relationships while sustaining consistent performance across varying modality conditions. This model was trained and evaluated utilizing 9,021 polysomnography (PSG) recordings from five independent datasets. achieving sensitivities up to 0.93 and macro F1 scores of 0.84, 0.85 across home, clinical, and research scenarios. This model serves as an event-level, multi-scenario diagnostic instrument for real-world applications of OSA, while also establishing itself as a means to deepen the mechanistic comprehension of respiratory processes in sleep disorders and their extensive health implications.

Conclusion: 这项工作对于实现实用且可扩展的量子增强通信系统至关重要，为里德堡阵列的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.

### [8] [Dynamic Multiple-Parameter Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform and its Intelligent Filtering Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16277)
*Manjun Cui,Ziqi Yan,Yangfan He,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出动态多参数联合时-顶点分数傅里叶变换(DMPJFRFT)框架，通过引入时变分数参数来实现动态图结构的自适应谱建模，在去噪和去模糊任务中优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有联合时-顶点变换仅能为空间域和时间域各分配一个分数阶，限制了其建模图信号复杂动态变化的能力。

Method: 提出DMPJFRFT框架，为每个时间步分配不同的分数阶，实现动态灵活的空时信号表示；开发了基于梯度下降和神经网络两种滤波方法用于动态信号恢复。

Result: 在动态图和视频数据集上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉时间拓扑变化，在去噪和去模糊任务中性能优于现有图基变换和神经网络方法。

Conclusion: DMPJFRFT通过时变分数参数实现了对动态图结构的自适应谱建模，为动态图信号处理提供了更灵活有效的工具。

Abstract: Dynamic graph signal processing provides a principled framework for analyzing time-varying data defined on irregular graph domains. However, existing joint time-vertex transforms such as the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform assign only one fractional order to the spatial domain and another one to the temporal domain, thereby restricting their capacity to model the complex and continuously varying dynamics of graph signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dynamic multiple-parameter joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (DMPJFRFT) framework, which introduces time-varying fractional parameters to achieve adaptive spectral modeling of dynamic graph structures. By assigning distinct fractional orders to each time step, the proposed transform enables dynamic and flexible representation of spatio-temporal signal evolution in the joint time-vertex spectral domain. Theoretical properties of the DMPJFRFT are systematically analyzed, and two filtering approaches: a gradient descent-based method and a neural network-based method, are developed for dynamic signal restoration. Experimental results on dynamic graph and video datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively captures temporal topology variations and achieves superior performance in denoising and deblurring tasks compared with some state-of-the-art graph-based transforms and neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIMO和PASS系统在联合通信与计算场景中存在性能瓶颈，需要设计新的框架来同时优化通信和计算性能，克服大规模路径损耗和波导内损耗。

Method: 采用分段PASS设计，提出三种操作协议（段选择、段聚合、段复用），分别针对计算导向和通信导向场景，开发了AO-MMSE和AO-WMMSE交替优化算法。

Result: 仿真结果显示：与常规MIMO和PASS相比，MSE分别降低70.65%和45.32%，WSR分别提升87.70%和51.35%。

Conclusion: 所提出的JCC-PASS框架在联合通信与计算场景中显著优于传统方法，为未来无线通信系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A joint communication and computation (JCC) framework using segmented pinching antenna system (PASS) is proposed, where both the communication bit streams and computation data are simultaneously transmitted via uplink communications. The segmented PASS design is used to yield the tractable uplink transmission, and to mitigate large-scale path loss and in-waveguide loss. Based on three operating protocols, namely segment selection (SS), segment aggregation (SA), and segment multiplexing (SM), the joint transmit and receive beamforming problem is formulated: 1) The mean square error (MSE) minimization problem is formulated for computation-oriented cases. To address this problem, a low-complexity alternating optimization-minimum mean square error (AO-MMSE) algorithm is developed. This problem is decomposed into receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems that are iteratively optimized by MMSE receivers to obtain the closed-form solutions. It is mathematically proved that the segmented JCC-PASS framework significantly outperforms the conventional PASS for the average in-waveguide propagation gain. 2) The weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem is formulated for communication-oriented cases. To solve the decomposed receiver-side and transmitter-side MSE subproblems, the AO-weighted minimum mean square error (AO-WMMSE) algorithm is further developed. An auxiliary weight variable is introduced to linearize the WSR function and is alternatively optimized based on WMMSE to derive the closed-form solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed JCC-PASS framework achieves up to 70.65% and 45.32% reductions in MSE compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, and ii) it reaches 87.70% and 51.35% improvements in WSR compared with conventional MIMO and conventional PASS, respectively.

Abstract: We present VersaPants, the first loose-fitting, textile-based capacitive sensing system for lower-body motion capture, built on the open-hardware VersaSens platform. By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Wireless Physical Layer Foundation Models (WPFMs) promise a new paradigm of universal Radio Frequency (RF) representations. However, these models inherit critical limitations found in deep learning such as the lack of explainability, robustness, adaptability, and verifiable compliance with physical and regulatory constraints. In addition, the vision for an AI-native 6G network demands a level of intelligence that is deeply embedded into the systems and is trustworthy. In this vision paper, we argue that the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which integrates data-driven neural networks with rule- and logic-based symbolic reasoning, is essential for bridging this gap. We envision a novel Neuro-Symbolic framework that integrates universal RF embeddings with symbolic knowledge graphs and differentiable logic layers. This hybrid approach enables models to learn from large datasets while reasoning over explicit domain knowledge, enabling trustworthy, generalizable, and efficient wireless AI that can meet the demands of future networks.

Abstract: Very wideband apertures are needed in positioning, sensing, spectrum monitoring, and modern spread spectrum, e.g., frequency hopping systems. Vivaldi antennas are one of the prominent choices for the aforementioned systems due to their natural wideband characteristics. Furthermore, tightly-coupled antenna arrays have been researched in the recent years to extend the lower band edge of compact arrays by taking advantage of the strong mutual coupling between the elements especially with dipole elements, but not with dual-polarized Vivaldi antennas. This paper presents a novel tightly-coupled dual-polarized antipodal Vivaldi antenna (TC-AVA) with -6 dB impedance bandwidth of 3 to 20 GHz. The tight coupling by overlapping the Vivaldi leaves is shown to extend the lower band edge from 3.75 to 3 GHz and 2.75 GHz, an improvement of 20% to 25% for both polarizations, compared with an isolated antipodal Vivaldi element.

Abstract: Ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are prone to mixed noise from physical activities, including baseline wander (BW), muscle artifact (MA), and electrode motion artifact (EM). Developing a method to remove such complex noise and reconstruct high-fidelity signals is clinically valuable for diagnostic accuracy. However, denoising of multi-beat ECG segments remains understudied and poses technical challenges. To address this, we propose Time-Frequency Complementary Diffusion (TFCDiff), a novel approach that operates in the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain and uses the DCT coefficients of noisy signals as conditioning input. To refine waveform details, we incorporate Temporal Feature Enhancement Mechanism (TFEM) to reinforce temporal representations and preserve key physiological information. Comparative experiments on a synthesized dataset demonstrate that TFCDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across five evaluation metrics. Furthermore, TFCDiff shows superior generalization on the unseen SimEMG Database, outperforming all benchmark models. Notably, TFCDiff processes raw 10-second sequences and maintains robustness under flexible random mixed noise (fRMN), enabling plug-and-play deployment in wearable ECG monitors for high-motion scenarios.

Conclusion: FRIS通过引入元素位置可重构性，为物理层安全提供了新的设计维度，能有效提升无线通信系统的保密性能。

Abstract: The concept of fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) upgrades the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) paradigm by empowering its reflecting elements with positioning reconfigurability. This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).

Motivation: SAM2在自然图像上表现出色，但在超声图像上性能显著下降。需要解决两个关键挑战：如何高效地将SAM2适配到超声成像领域并保持参数效率，以及如何在资源受限的临床环境中有效部署适配后的模型。

Method: 1. 提出上下文-边缘混合适配器(CH-Adapter)，增强对多样化超声成像模态的细粒度感知，实现参数高效微调；2. 开发深度监督知识蒸馏(DSKD)技术，将微调后SAM2的大型图像编码器知识转移到超轻量编码器。

Result: UniUltra在广泛实验中优于现有最先进方法，具有优越的泛化能力。微调时仅使用SAM2参数的8.91%，最终压缩模型相比原始SAM2减少94.08%的参数，性能不受影响。

Conclusion: UniUltra框架在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算需求，非常适合实际临床部署，为超声图像分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrates remarkable universal segmentation capabilities on natural images. However, its performance on ultrasound images is significantly degraded due to domain disparities. This limitation raises two critical challenges: how to efficiently adapt SAM2 to ultrasound imaging while maintaining parameter efficiency, and how to deploy the adapted model effectively in resource-constrained clinical environments. To address these issues, we propose UniUltra for universal ultrasound segmentation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel context-edge hybrid adapter (CH-Adapter) that enhances fine-grained perception across diverse ultrasound imaging modalities while achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To further improve clinical applicability, we develop a deep-supervised knowledge distillation (DSKD) technique that transfers knowledge from the large image encoder of the fine-tuned SAM2 to a super lightweight encoder, substantially reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUltra outperforms state-of-the-arts with superior generalization capabilities. Notably, our framework achieves competitive performance using only 8.91% of SAM2's parameters during fine-tuning, and the final compressed model reduces the parameter count by 94.08% compared to the original SAM2, making it highly suitable for practical clinical deployment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.
