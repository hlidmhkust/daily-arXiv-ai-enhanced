Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we study employing movable components on both base station
(BS) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in a wideband terahertz (THz)
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system, where the BS is equipped with a
movable antenna (MA) array and the IRS consists of movable subarrays. To
alleviate double beam squint effect caused by the coupling of beam squint at
the BS and IRS, we propose to maximize the minimal received power across a wide
THz spectrum by delicately configuring the positions of MAs and IRS subarrays,
which is highly challenging. By adopting majorization-minimization (MM)
methodology, we develop an algorithm to tackle the aforementioned optimization.
Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and
the benefit of utilizing movable components on the BS and IRS to mitigate
double beam squint effect in wideband THz communications.

### [4] [Analysis of Semantic Communication for Logic-based Hypothesis Deduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21755)

Abstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of
First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set
of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has
incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth.
The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver
identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the
objective as approximating the posterior distribution at the transmitter to the
receiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained,
finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's
non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality.
Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and
multi-round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an m-ary
Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule,
our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget
constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical
findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection
and prior methods.

### [5] [A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21079)
*Kaixuan Bao,Wei Xu,Xiaohu You,Derrick Wing Kwan Ng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了算术级可变精度计算(AL-VPC)框架，通过为每个算术运算优化计算精度，在无线通信中平衡计算性能和复杂度，相比传统固定精度方法可提升60%和速率或降低30%复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算复杂度是无线通信中的重大挑战，现有方法主要通过算法特定途径来降低复杂度，但计算精度这一直接影响计算性能和复杂度的基本维度在文献中很少被探索

Method: 建立算术级可变精度计算统一框架，开发基于随机分析的算术传播误差模型，构建数学优化问题来平衡计算性能和复杂度，提出离线VPC和在线VPC两种算法

Result: 在迫零预编码案例研究中，揭示了计算性能与复杂度之间的帕累托边界，相比传统固定长度方法可达到60%和速率提升或30%复杂度降低

Conclusion: AL-VPC框架通过优化每个算术运算的计算精度，有效解决了无线通信中的计算复杂度问题，为可变精度计算在通信系统中的应用提供了理论基础和实用算法

Abstract: Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless
communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through
algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which
directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is
a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the
emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing
(VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a
distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we
establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing
(AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each
arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model
exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization
problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational
complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to
solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a
case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary
between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60%
sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared
to the traditional fixed-length methods.

### [6] [Hybrid Codebook Design for Localization Using Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21351)
*Alireza Fadakar,Yuchen Zhang,Hui Chen,Musa Furkan Keskin,Henk Wymeersch,Andreas F. Molisch*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究电磁可重构流体天线系统(ER-FAS)在下行链路定位中的应用，提出了两种可重构性范式的混合预编码设计，显著提升了用户设备定位精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要利用ER-FAS提升频谱效率，本文探索其在定位领域的应用潜力，通过动态控制天线电磁特性来增强定位性能

Method: 考虑MISO系统，提出两种可重构性范式：合成模型（从有限电磁基函数生成波束模式）和有限状态选择模型（从预定义模式集中选择）。针对两种范式分别设计了联合基带和电磁预编码器，推导了闭式表达式和低复杂度算法

Result: 分析边界和大量仿真表明，所提出的ER-FAS混合设计相比传统不可重构阵列显著提高了UE定位精度

Conclusion: ER-FAS通过电磁域的可重构性为无线定位提供了新的自由度，所提出的混合预编码设计能够有效利用这种可重构性来提升定位性能

Abstract: Electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna systems (ER-FAS) introduce
additional degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain by dynamically
steering per-antenna radiation patterns, thereby enhancing power efficiency in
wireless links. Unlike prior works on spatially reconfigurable FAS, which
adjust element positions, ER-FAS provides direct control over each element's EM
characteristics to realize on-demand beam-pattern shaping. While existing
studies have exploited ER-FAS to boost spectral efficiency, this paper explores
its application for downlink localization. We consider a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) system in which a multi-antenna ER-FAS at the base station
serves a single-antenna user equipment (UE). We consider two reconfigurability
paradigms: (i) a synthesis model where each antenna generates desired
beampatterns from a finite set of EM basis functions, and (ii) a finite-state
selection model in which each antenna selects a pattern from a predefined set
of patterns. For both paradigms, we formulate the joint baseband (BB) and EM
precoder design to minimize the UE position error bound. In the synthesis case
we derive low-dimensional closed-form expressions for both the BB and EM
precoders. For the finite-state model we obtain closed-form BB structures and
propose a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent algorithm for EM pattern
selection. Analytical bounds and extensive simulations show that the proposed
hybrid designs for ER-FAS substantially improve UE positioning accuracy over
traditional non-reconfigurable arrays.

### [7] [Channel Estimation and Data Detection in DS-Spread Channels: A Unified Framework, Novel Algorithms, and Waveform Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21373)
*Niladri Halder,Chandra R. Murthy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的水声通信接收处理框架，比较了OFDM、OTFS、OCDM和ODSS四种调制波形在延迟扩展信道下的性能，并开发了新的变分贝叶斯信道估计算法和软符号检测算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下声学通信中的延迟扩展信道对传统调制技术构成挑战，需要开发统一的处理框架来公平比较不同调制波形的性能，并设计高效的信道估计和数据检测算法。

Method: 建立了统一的输入-输出关系框架，开发了迭代变分贝叶斯离网信道估计算法（FVB和SVB），提出了低复杂度变分软符号检测算法（VSSD）和数据辅助迭代信道估计与检测方案（ICED）。

Result: 数值结果表明，在无编码通信中，ODSS性能最佳，OCDM和OTFS次之，OFDM最差；使用VSSD算法时，OTFS、OCDM和ODSS性能相似且优于OFDM；在编码通信中使用VSSD接收机时，所有波形BER性能几乎相同。

Conclusion: 当接收机复杂度受限时，波形选择很重要（特别是在恶劣信道条件下），但使用更复杂的接收算法时，不同波形之间的性能差异会消失。

Abstract: We present a unified receiver processing framework for communication over
delay-scale (DS)-spread channels that arise in underwater acoustic (UWA)
communications that addresses both channel estimation (CE) and data detection
for different modulation waveforms, namely OFDM, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS, through
a common input--output relation. Using this framework, we conduct a fair and
comprehensive comparative study of these waveforms under DS-spread UWA channels
and similar receiver complexities.
  We also develop a novel iterative variational Bayesian (VB) off-grid CE
algorithm to estimate the delay and scale parameters of the channel paths, via
two approaches: a first-order approximation scheme (FVB) and a second-order
approximation scheme (SVB). We propose a low-complexity variational soft symbol
detection (VSSD) algorithm that outputs soft symbols and log-likelihood ratios
for the data bits, and a data-aided iterative CE and data detection (ICED)
scheme that utilizes detected data symbols as \emph{virtual} pilots to further
improve the CE and data detection accuracy.
  Our numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for CE
and data detection. In terms of relative performance of different waveforms, in
uncoded communications, (a) with a low-complexity subcarrier-by-subcarrier
equalizer, ODSS offers the best performance, followed by OCDM and OTFS, while
OFDM performs the worst, and (b) with the VSSD algorithm, OTFS, OCDM, and ODSS
perform similarly, and they outperform OFDM. With coded communications,
interestingly, all waveforms offer nearly the same BER when the VSSD receiver
is employed. Hence, we conclude that when the receiver complexity is
constrained, waveform choice matters, especially under harsh channel
conditions, whereas with more sophisticated receiver algorithms, these
differences disappear.

### [8] [Sampling Theory of Jointly Bandlimited Time-vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21412)
*Hang Sheng,Hui Feng,Junhao Yu,Feng Ji,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间-顶点图信号(TVGS)的临界采样问题，证明了联合频带限制TVGS的采样密度下界，并提出了不同TVGS类型的采样重建方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间-顶点图信号模型描述具有不规则结构的时变数据，其联合时-顶点傅里叶谱域的频带限制性反映了时间和图拓扑上的平滑性，需要研究其临界采样理论

Method: 针对连续时间信号、无限长序列和有限长序列三种TVGS类型，分析联合频带限制信号的采样密度下界，提出采样重建程序，并在数值和真实数据集上验证

Result: 证明了联合频带限制TVGS的采样密度或采样比率下界，该下界取决于联合时-顶点傅里叶谱域中频谱支撑的测度，并给出了完美恢复的采样集下界

Conclusion: 临界采样是可实现的，提出的采样方案适用于不同类型的TVGS，为时间-顶点图信号处理提供了理论基础和实用方法

Abstract: Time-vertex graph signal (TVGS) models describe time-varying data with
irregular structures. The bandlimitedness in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain reflects smoothness in both temporal and graph topology. In
this paper, we study the critical sampling of three types of TVGS including
continuous-time signals, infinite-length sequences, and finite-length sequences
in the time domain for each vertex on the graph. For a jointly bandlimited
TVGS, we prove a lower bound on sampling density or sampling ratio, which
depends on the measure of the spectral support in the joint time-vertex Fourier
spectral domain. We also provide a lower bound on the sampling density or
sampling ratio of each vertex on sampling sets for perfect recovery. To
demonstrate that critical sampling is achievable, we propose the sampling and
reconstruction procedures for the different types of TVGS. Finally, we show how
the proposed sampling schemes can be applied to numerical as well as real
datasets.

### [9] [Subset Random Sampling and Reconstruction of Finite Time-Vertex Graph Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21415)
*Hang Sheng,Qinji Shu,Hui Feng,Bo Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对有限时间-顶点图信号的子集随机采样方案，通过先随机选择行列子矩阵再在子矩阵内采样的方式，解决了实际应用中只能在部分顶点和时间点采样的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机采样方法允许在任何顶点和时间点采样，但实际应用中采样通常只能限于部分顶点和时刻，因此需要研究更适合实际场景的采样方案。

Method: 提出子集随机采样方案：先随机选择行列形成子矩阵，然后在子矩阵内进行随机采样。同时提出了结合低秩、稀疏性和平滑性先验（LSSP）的重建框架。

Result: 理论上给出了高概率重建原始信号的条件，实验验证了重建的可行性和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该子集随机采样方案能够有效解决实际采样限制问题，结合LSSP重建框架可以实现对有限时间-顶点图信号的高质量重建。

Abstract: Finite time-vertex graph signals (FTVGS) provide an efficient representation
for capturing spatio-temporal correlations across multiple data sources on
irregular structures. Although sampling and reconstruction of FTVGS with known
spectral support have been extensively studied, the case of unknown spectral
support requires further investigation. Existing random sampling methods may
extract samples from any vertex at any time, but such strategies are not
friendly in practice, where sampling is typically limited to a subset of
vertices and moments. To address this requirement, we propose a subset random
sampling scheme for FTVGS. Specifically, we first randomly select a subset of
rows and columns to form a submatrix, followed by random sampling within that
submatrix. In theory, we provide sufficient conditions for reconstructing the
original FTVGS with high probability. Additionally, we introduce a
reconstruction framework incorporating low-rank, sparsity, and smoothness
priors (LSSP), and verify the feasibility of the reconstruction and the
effectiveness of the framework through experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超快速且准确的物理层模型对于设计、优化和管理超宽带光传输系统至关重要，需要提高模型的可靠性、准确性和通用性

Conclusion: 该方法显示了很好的准确性和广泛的适用性，并提供了可以根据任何系统布局进行重配置的软件实现，已开源发布

Abstract: Ultrafast and accurate physical layer models are essential for designing,
optimizing and managing ultra-wideband optical transmission systems. We present
a closed-form GN/EGN model, named Polynomial Closed-Form Model (PCFM),
improving reliability, accuracy, and generality. The key to deriving PCFM is
expressing the spatial power profile of each channel along a span as a
polynomial. Then, under reasonable approximations, the integral calculation can
be carried out analytically, for any chosen degree of the polynomial. We
present a full detailed derivation of the model. We then validate it vs. the
numerically integrated GN-model in a challenging multiband (C+L+S) scenario,
including Raman amplification and inter-channel Raman scattering. We then show
that the approach works well also in the special case of the presence of
multiple lumped loss along the fiber. Overall, the approach shows very good
accuracy and broad applicability. A software implementing the model, fully
reconfigurable to any type of system layout, is available for download under

### [11] [Energy Detection over Composite $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels with Inverse Gaussian Distribution in Ultra mMTC Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21614)
*He Huang,Zeping Sui,Zilong Liu,Wei Huang,Md. Noor-A-Rahim,Haishi Wang,Zhiheng Hu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了超大规模机器类型通信网络中基于κ-μ阴影复合衰落信道的能量检测特性，首次推导了截断式闭式平均检测概率表达式，发现传播路径数比平均SNR对检测概率影响更大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究6G mMTC网络中能量检测在复合衰落信道下的性能特性，为网络设计提供理论指导

Method: 基于逆高斯分布推导SNR的概率密度函数闭式表达式，采用新颖的积分和数学变换技术推导截断式闭式平均检测概率表达式

Result: 仿真显示传播路径数比平均SNR对平均检测概率的影响更显著，这与之前设备到设备网络的研究结论相反

Conclusion: 6G mMTC网络设计应重点考虑增强发射机-接收机布局和天线对准策略，而非单纯提高设备间平均SNR

Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics of energy detection (ED) over
composite $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading channels in ultra machine-type
communication (mMTC) networks. We have derived the closed-form expressions of
the probability density function (PDF) of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on
the Inverse Gaussian (\emph{IG}) distribution. By adopting novel integration
and mathematical transformation techniques, we derive a truncation-based
closed-form expression for the average detection probability for the first
time. It can be observed from our simulations that the number of propagation
paths has a more pronounced effect on average detection probability compared to
average SNR, which is in contrast to earlier studies that focus on
device-to-device networks. It suggests that for 6G mMTC network design, we
should consider enhancing transmitter-receiver placement and antenna alignment
strategies, rather than relying solely on increasing the device-to-device
average SNR.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在室内近场RF无线能量传输场景下的无线电线条系统部署，通过聚类和天线位置优化来最大化热点区域的最小接收力率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内能量需求集中在特定热点区域的RF无线能量传输问题，优化无线电线条系统的部署以提高能量传输效率。

Method: 将问题解耦为两个阶段：基于空间位置和近场传播特性的热点聚类，以及天线元件位置优化。提出四种部署算法，包括SCA、SGP、直线形和多边形形状约束方案。

Conclusion: 论文提出的聚类和部署算法能够有效提高室内RF无线能量传输系统的性能，不同形状的部署方案在不同场景下各具优势，为实际应用提供了灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the deployment of radio stripe systems for indoor
radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) in line-of-sight near-field
scenarios. The focus is on environments where energy demand is concentrated in
specific areas, referred to as 'hotspots', spatial zones with higher user
density or consistent energy requirements. We formulate a joint clustering and
radio stripe deployment problem that aims to maximize the minimum received
power across all hotspots. To address the complexity, we decouple the problem
into two stages: i) clustering for assigning radio stripes to hotspots based on
their spatial positions and near-field propagation characteristics, and ii)
antenna element placement optimization. In particular, we propose four radio
stripe deployment algorithms. Two are based on general successive convex
approximation (SCA) and signomial programming (SGP) methods. The other two are
shape-constrained solutions where antenna elements are arranged along either
straight lines or regular polygons, enabling simpler deployment. Numerical
results show that the proposed clustering method converges effectively, with
Chebyshev initialization significantly outperforming random initialization. The
optimized deployments consistently outperform baseline benchmarks across a wide
range of frequencies and radio stripe lengths, while the polygon-shaped
deployment achieves better performance compared to other approaches. Meanwhile,
the line-shaped deployment demonstrates an advantage under high boresight gain
settings, benefiting from increased spatial diversity and broader angular
coverage.

### [13] [Machine Intelligence on the Edge: Interpretable Cardiac Pattern Localisation Using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21652)
*Haozhe Tian,Qiyu Rao,Nina Moutonnet,Pietro Ferraro,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了序列匹配滤波器(SMF)方法，使用强化学习设计滤波器序列，解决低信噪比信号中传统匹配滤波器性能下降的问题，在ECG信号检测中取得了先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配滤波器在低信噪比信号(如边缘设备记录的ear-ECG)中性能下降，因为噪声模式可能与目标信号相似。需要一种能够适应低信噪比环境的可靠且可解释的滤波器设计方法。

Method: 使用强化学习代理设计滤波器序列，将滤波器设计建模为序列决策过程，生成信号特定的滤波器序列，同时保持完全可解释性。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的真实ECG数据集上实现了最先进的R峰检测和生理状态分类性能。

Conclusion: SMF框架在临床决策支持方面具有强大潜力，可扩展到各种需要从噪声污染信号中准确定位模式的应用场景。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

Abstract: Motor Imagery-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are systems that
detect and interpret brain activity patterns linked to the mental visualization
of movement, and then translate these into instructions for controlling
external robotic or domotic devices. Such devices have the potential to be
useful in a broad variety of applications. While implementing a system that
would help individuals restore some freedom levels, the interpretation of
(Electroencephalography) EEG data remains a complex and unsolved problem. In
the literature, the classification of left and right imagined movements has
been extensively studied. This study introduces a novel pipeline that makes use
of machine learning techniques for classifying MI EEG data. The entire
framework is capable of accurately categorizing left and imagined motions, as
well as rest phases, for a set of 52 subjects who performed a MI task. We
trained a within subject model on each individual subject. The methodology has
been offline evaluated and compared to four studies that are currently the
state-of-the-art regarding the specified dataset. The results show that our
proposed framework could be used with MI-BCI systems in light of its failsafe
classification performances, i.e. 99.5% in accuracy
