*Quang-Khai Bui-Tran,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Manh D. Ho,Thinh B. Lam,Vi Vu,Hoang-Thien Nguyen,Phat Huynh,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UP2D是一个用于医学图像分割的无源域自适应框架，通过不确定性感知的渐进式伪标签去噪来解决域偏移问题，在三个视网膜眼底基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在域偏移下性能严重下降，且由于数据共享限制无法访问源图像，需要开发无源域自适应方法。

Method: UP2D包含三个关键组件：精炼原型过滤模块抑制无信息区域并构建可靠类别原型；不确定性引导的EMA策略基于空间加权边界不确定性选择性更新教师模型；基于分位数的熵最小化方案专注于模糊区域学习。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的视网膜眼底基准测试中，UP2D在标准和开放域设置下均达到最先进性能，优于先前的UDA和SFDA方法，同时保持优越的边界精度。

Conclusion: UP2D通过渐进式改进伪标签质量和减少确认偏差，有效解决了无源域自适应中的伪标签噪声和类别不平衡问题，在医学图像分割领域表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models face severe performance drops under domain
shifts, especially when data sharing constraints prevent access to source
images. We present a novel Uncertainty-aware Progressive Pseudo-label Denoising
(UP2D) framework for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), designed to mitigate
noisy pseudo-labels and class imbalance during adaptation. UP2D integrates
three key components: (i) a Refined Prototype Filtering module that suppresses
uninformative regions and constructs reliable class prototypes to denoise
pseudo-labels, (ii) an Uncertainty-Guided EMA (UG-EMA) strategy that
selectively updates the teacher model based on spatially weighted boundary
uncertainty, and (iii) a quantile-based entropy minimization scheme that
focuses learning on ambiguous regions while avoiding overconfidence on easy
pixels. This single-stage student-teacher framework progressively improves
pseudo-label quality and reduces confirmation bias. Extensive experiments on
three challenging retinal fundus benchmarks demonstrate that UP2D achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both standard and open-domain settings,
outperforming prior UDA and SFDA approaches while maintaining superior boundary
precision.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究针对医学图像分析中的数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，以人类胚胎延时成像为例，通过优化R3GAN训练策略生成高质量图像，有效提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析常面临数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，限制了深度学习模型在临床应用中的效果。本研究旨在探索如何优化GAN在小数据集上的表现，生成具有诊断意义的真实图像。

Method: 基于R3GAN进行系统实验，建立了有效的训练策略，设计了针对256x256分辨率数据集的优化配置，包括完整预热阶段和低且逐渐增加的gamma范围（5→40）。使用生成样本来平衡不平衡的胚胎数据集。

Result: 生成样本显著改善了分类性能，t3类别的召回率从0.06提升到0.69，F1分数从0.11提升到0.60，且不影响其他类别的表现。

Conclusion: 定制的R3GAN训练策略能有效缓解小规模医学成像任务中的数据稀缺问题，提高模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance,
limiting the effectiveness of deep learning models in clinical applications.
Using human embryo time-lapse imaging (TLI) as a case study, this work
investigates how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be optimized for
small datasets to generate realistic and diagnostically meaningful images.
Based on systematic experiments with R3GAN, we established effective training
strategies and designed an optimized configuration for 256x256-resolution
datasets, featuring a full burn-in phase and a low, gradually increasing gamma
range (5 -> 40). The generated samples were used to balance an imbalanced
embryo dataset, leading to substantial improvement in classification
performance. The recall and F1-score of t3 increased from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11
to 0.60, respectively, without compromising other classes. These results
demonstrate that tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate
data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging
tasks.

### [3] [Diffusion-Driven Generation of Minimally Preprocessed Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26834)
*Samuel W. Remedios,Aaron Carass,Jerry L. Prince,Blake E. Dewey*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究提出并比较了三种用于生成3D T1加权MRI人脑图像的DDPM模型，使用42,406名受试者的80,675个图像体积进行训练，是首个无需颅骨剥离或配准的3D非潜在扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够生成具有自然方向变化和场不均匀性的3D T1加权脑MRI图像的扩散模型，同时避免常见的预处理步骤如配准和偏置场校正。

Method: 使用来自38个公开脑MRI数据集的80,675个图像体积训练三种DDPM模型，图像仅经过最小预处理，保留了数据的视觉变异性，未进行配准或偏置场校正。

Result: 所有三种DDPM都能生成连贯的MR脑体积，速度和流预测模型比样本预测模型获得更低的FID分数，但所有模型在多个队列中的FID均高于真实图像，生成的大脑区域体积分布在统计学上与真实数据存在差异。

Conclusion: 尽管在统计测试中存在负面结果，但提出的DDPM能够生成高分辨率3D T1加权脑图像，所有模型权重和推理代码已公开。

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present and compare three denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) that generate 3D $T_1$-weighted MRI human brain
images. Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406
subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had
approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three
human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and
excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the
visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce
images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were
neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected.
Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and
qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent
MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs
than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs
compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment,
the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from
real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer
statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In
conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion
model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the
negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of
generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images. All model weights
and corresponding inference code are publicly available at

*Mingcui Zhang,Zhigang Jia*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出基于双四元数矩阵分解的脆弱零水印模型，用于医疗图像的版权保护和内容篡改检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像在传输和共享过程中面临版权归属和内容篡改的风险，需要有效的保护手段

Method: 利用双四元数的标准部分和对偶部分之间的运算关系，将原始载体图像与水印图像关联，基于双四元数矩阵分解特性生成零水印信息

Result: 实现了医疗图像的版权保护和内容篡改检测功能

Conclusion: 基于双四元数矩阵分解的脆弱零水印技术为医疗图像保护提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote
consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and
sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content
tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an
effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology
focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by
extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting
medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model
based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational
relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to
correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates
zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion
matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content
tampering detection for medical images.

### [5] [Towards robust quantitative photoacoustic tomography via learned iterative methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27487)
*Anssi Manninen,Janek Gröhl,Felix Lucka,Andreas Hauptmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于模型的学习迭代方法用于定量光声层析成像(QPAT)，通过将模型信息迭代提供给更新网络，在训练数据稀缺的情况下实现更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QPAT重建方法依赖充分先验信息且计算缓慢，深度学习重建方法需要大量训练数据，但实际应用中训练数据往往稀缺。

Method: 采用基于模型的学习迭代方法，比较基于梯度下降、高斯-牛顿和拟牛顿方法的不同学习更新策略，包括贪婪学习和端到端学习两种训练方式。

Result: 在理想模拟数据和模拟稀缺训练数据及高建模误差的数字孪生数据集上测试了所实现的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在训练数据稀缺的情况下仍能实现良好的重建性能，为QPAT提供了一种有效的替代解决方案。

Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a medical imaging modality that can provide
high-resolution tissue images based on the optical absorption. Classical
reconstruction methods for quantifying the absorption coefficients rely on
sufficient prior information to overcome noisy and imperfect measurements. As
these methods utilize computationally expensive forward models, the computation
becomes slow, limiting their potential for time-critical applications. As an
alternative approach, deep learning-based reconstruction methods have been
established for faster and more accurate reconstructions. However, most of
these methods rely on having a large amount of training data, which is not the
case in practice. In this work, we adopt the model-based learned iterative
approach for the use in Quantitative PAT (QPAT), in which additional
information from the model is iteratively provided to the updating networks,
allowing better generalizability with scarce training data. We compare the
performance of different learned updates based on gradient descent,
Gauss-Newton, and Quasi-Newton methods. The learning tasks are formulated as
greedy, requiring iterate-wise optimality, as well as end-to-end, where all
networks are trained jointly. The implemented methods are tested with ideal
simulated data as well as against a digital twin dataset that emulates scarce
training data and high modeling error.

### [6] [Combined fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of tozuleristide in muscle tissue in vitro -- toward optically-guided solid tumor surgery: feasibility studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27595)
*Ruibo Shang,Matthew Thompson,Matthew D. Carson,Eric J. Seibel,Matthew O'Donnell,Ivan Pelivanov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出快速扫描光声-超声(PAUS)成像技术来补充近红外荧光(NIRF)，解决NIRF在组织深度超过5mm时的灵敏度和分辨率限制问题，实现更全面的肿瘤检测和广泛边缘切除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近红外荧光(NIRF)在肿瘤切除手术中具有高对比度、视频速率和非接触成像的优势，但在组织深度超过约5mm时存在灵敏度和分辨率限制，这限制了其在广泛边缘切除中的应用。

Method: 采用快速扫描光声-超声(PAUS)成像技术，在暗红色牛肌肉组织中进行体外可行性研究，测试临床阶段研究性成像剂tozuleristide的检测能力，并评估光谱PAUS成像的性能。

Result: PAUS扫描能够在深度达约34mm处识别20μM浓度的tozuleristide，显著扩展了NIRF的能力。光谱PAUS成像在约8mm深度显示出改善的光谱精度和PA检测限，并大幅减少图像伪影。

Conclusion: 结合NIRF和PAUS的方法有望为光学引导的实体肿瘤手术提供全面的术前(PA)和术中(NIRF)肿瘤检测及广泛边缘切除能力。

Abstract: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) can deliver high-contrast, video-rate,
non-contact imaging of tumor-targeted contrast agents with the potential to
guide surgeries excising solid tumors. However, it has been met with skepticism
for wide-margin excision due to sensitivity and resolution limitations at
depths larger than ~5 mm in tissue. To address this limitation, fast-sweep
photoacoustic-ultrasound (PAUS) imaging is proposed to complement NIRF. In an
exploratory in vitro feasibility study using dark-red bovine muscle tissue, we
observed that PAUS scanning can identify tozuleristide, a clinical stage
investigational imaging agent, at a concentration of 20 uM from the background
at depths of up to ~34 mm, highly extending the capabilities of NIRF alone. The
capability of spectroscopic PAUS imaging was tested by direct injection of 20
uM tozuleristide into bovine muscle tissue at a depth of ~ 8 mm. It is shown
that laser-fluence compensation and strong clutter suppression enabled by the
unique capabilities of the fast-sweep approach greatly improve spectroscopic
accuracy and the PA detection limit, and strongly reduce image artifacts. Thus,
the combined NIRF-PAUS approach can be promising for comprehensive pre- (with
PA) and intra- (with NIRF) operative solid tumor detection and wide-margin
excision in optically guided solid tumor surgery.

### [7] [Navigated hepatic tumor resection using intraoperative ultrasound imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27596)
*Karin Olthof,Theo Ruers,Tiziano Natali,Lisanne Venix,Jasper Smit,Anne den Hartor,Niels Kok,Matteo Fusaglia,Koert Kuhlmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于术中超声的导航系统在肝脏手术中的可行性和准确性，该系统无需术前影像配准，直接使用术中超声生成3D模型进行导航引导切除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖术前影像配准，而本研究旨在开发一种仅使用术中超声的注册自由导航方法，以简化工作流程并提高准确性。

Method: 在25例肝转移瘤切除患者中进行试点研究，使用电磁传感器补偿器官运动，获取超声体积数据，自动分割血管，半自动分割肿瘤，生成3D模型并与跟踪的手术器械一起可视化。

Result: 在20例患者中成功建立导航，完整导航工作流程在5-10分钟内完成。16例可评估患者的导航精度中位数为3.2毫米，93.8%的患者实现了R0切除。

Conclusion: 仅基于术中超声的导航在肝脏手术中可行且准确，这种注册自由方法为更简单、更准确的图像引导系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Purpose: This proof-of-concept study evaluates feasibility and accuracy of an
ultrasound-based navigation system for open liver surgery. Unlike most
conventional systems that rely on registration to preoperative imaging, the
proposed system provides navigation-guided resection using 3D models generated
from intraoperative ultrasound.
  Methods: A pilot study was conducted in 25 patients undergoing resection of
liver metastases. The first five cases served to optimize the workflow.
Intraoperatively, an electromagnetic sensor compensated for organ motion, after
which an ultrasound volume was acquired. Vasculature was segmented
automatically and tumors semi-automatically using region-growing (n=15) or a
deep learning algorithm (n=5). The resulting 3D model was visualized alongside
tracked surgical instruments. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the distance
between surgical clips and tumors in the navigation software with the same
distance on a postoperative CT of the resected specimen.
  Results: Navigation was successfully established in all 20 patients. However,
four cases were excluded from accuracy assessment due to intraoperative sensor
detachment (n=3) or incorrect data recording (n=1). The complete navigation
workflow was operational within 5-10 minutes. In 16 evaluable patients, 78
clip-to-tumor distances were analyzed. The median navigation accuracy was 3.2
mm [IQR: 2.8-4.8 mm], and an R0 resection was achieved in 15/16 (93.8%)
patients and one patient had an R1 vascular resection.
  Conclusion: Navigation based solely on intra-operative ultrasound is feasible
and accurate for liver surgery. This registration-free approach paves the way
for simpler and more accurate image guidance systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯交叉验证和数据分裂的无监督模型选择和错误设定检测方法，适用于计算成像中的贝叶斯模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督模型评估方法在计算成像中不适用，因为计算成本高且与机器学习定义的现代图像先验不兼容。

Result: 在各种评分规则和模型错误设定类型的实验中，实现了出色的选择和检测精度，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: 该方法为贝叶斯成像科学中的无监督模型评估提供了一种通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to
address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper
addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground
truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification
diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable
for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and
incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine
learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model
selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on
a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized
measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian
imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate
the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types
of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection
accuracy with a low computational cost.

### [9] [Investigation of Superdirectivity in Planar Holographic Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26803)
*Hang Lin,Liuxun Xue,Shu Sun,Ruifeng Gao,Jue Wang,Tengjiao Wang*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究均匀矩形阵列的超指向性特性，为5G/6G通信系统中的全息阵列优化提供理论基础。

Method: 建立均匀矩形阵列的数学指向性模型，推导最大指向性的解析表达式，结合数值模拟进行系统性分析。

Result: 结果表明通过合理利用耦合效应可显著增强指向性，但当天线间距进入深亚波长尺度时，增强效果呈现边际递减。

Conclusion: 本研究为超指向性均匀矩形阵列的设计提供了理论基础，对5G/6G通信系统中的全息阵列优化具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: This paper studies the superdirectivity characteristics of uniform
rectangular arrays (URAs) for holographic multiple-input multiple-output
systems. By establishing a mathematical directivity model for the URA, an
analytical expression for the maximum directivity is derived. Accordingly,
systematic analysis is performed in conjunction with numerical simulations.
Results show that the directivity can be significantly enhanced via rational
utilization of coupling effects. However, this enhancement yields diminishing
returns when antenna spacings transition to deep sub-wavelength scales. This
study provides a theoretical basis for the design of superdirective URAs and
offers valuable insights for holographic array optimization in 5G/6G
communication systems.

*Yuanhang Qian,Xueqin Luo,Jilu Jin,Gongping Huang,Jingdong Chen,Jacob Benesty*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义线性超阵列优化框架，联合优化阵列几何、元件指向性和波束形成滤波器，以最小化设计波束模式与理想指向性模式之间的近似误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用Jacobi-Anger级数展开近似理想指向性模式来推导波束形成器，通过遗传算法优化阵列几何和元件指向性。

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提出的优化阵列在目标频带和转向范围内比传统线性超阵列具有更低的近似误差，其指向性因子和白噪声增益在频率和转向角度上表现出更稳定和改善的性能。

Conclusion: 该联合优化框架有效提升了线性超阵列的波束形成性能，在频带和转向范围内实现了更好的性能稳定性。

Abstract: Linear superarrays (LSAs) have been proposed to address the limited steering
capability of conventional linear differential microphone arrays (LDMAs) by
integrating omnidirectional and directional microphones, enabling more flexible
beamformer designs. However, existing approaches remain limited because array
geometry and element directivity, both critical to beamforming performance, are
not jointly optimized. This paper presents a generalized LSA optimization
framework that simultaneously optimizes array geometry, element directivity,
and the beamforming filter to minimize the approximation error between the
designed beampattern and an ideal directivity pattern (IDP) over the full
frequency band and all steering directions within the region of interest. The
beamformer is derived by approximating the IDP using a Jacobi-Anger series
expansion, while the array geometry and element directivity are optimized via a
genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed optimized array
achieves lower approximation error than conventional LSAs across the target
frequency band and steering range. Additionally, its directivity factor and
white noise gain demonstrate more stable and improved performance across
frequencies and steering angles.

*Dian Chen,Yunkai Chen,Tong Lin,Sijie Chen,Xiaolin Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GeoPep是一个基于ESM3多模态蛋白质基础模型的肽结合位点预测框架，通过迁移学习和参数高效神经网络架构，解决了蛋白质-肽相互作用预测中肽构象灵活性和结构数据有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于肽的构象灵活性和结构数据有限，现有的多模态方法难以直接应用于蛋白质-肽相互作用预测，需要开发能够处理稀疏数据的有效方法。

Method: 通过微调ESM3的预训练表征，结合参数高效神经网络架构，并使用基于距离的损失函数来利用3D结构信息增强结合位点预测。

Result: 综合评估表明，GeoPep在蛋白质-肽结合位点预测方面显著优于现有方法，能够有效捕捉稀疏和异质的结合模式。

Conclusion: GeoPep通过迁移学习和结构信息利用，成功解决了蛋白质-肽相互作用预测的挑战，为这一领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have
achieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However,
extending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due
to the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited
availability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware
models. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework
for peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3,
a multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich
pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited
availability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further
integrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of
learning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained
using distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to
enhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding
site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding
patterns.

*Hao Jiang,Xiaojun Yuan,Yinuo Huang,Qinghua Guo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Blind-MIMOSC的盲多输入多输出语义通信框架，使用深度联合源信道编码发射机和基于扩散的盲接收机，无需导频即可同时恢复信道和源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统通信系统中需要导频进行信道估计的问题，实现完全无导频的联合信道估计和源数据恢复，提高频谱效率。

Method: 采用深度联合源信道编码(DJSCC)发射机压缩源数据，接收端使用并行变分扩散(PVD)模型，利用两个预训练评分网络分别表征信道和源数据的先验信息。

Result: 实验表明Blind-MIMOSC在信道和源数据恢复精度上优于现有方法，同时大幅降低信道带宽比。

Conclusion: 这是首个在块衰落MIMO系统中实现完全无导频联合信道估计和源数据恢复的解决方案，具有插拔式重训练优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel blind multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
semantic communication (SC) framework named Blind-MIMOSC that consists of a
deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) transmitter and a diffusion-based
blind receiver. The DJSCC transmitter aims to compress and map the source data
into the transmitted signal by exploiting the structural characteristics of the
source data, while the diffusion-based blind receiver employs a parallel
variational diffusion (PVD) model to simultaneously recover the channel and the
source data from the received signal without using any pilots. The PVD model
leverages two pre-trained score networks to characterize the prior information
of the channel and the source data, operating in a plug-and-play manner during
inference. This design allows only the affected network to be retrained when
channel conditions or source datasets change, avoiding the complicated
full-network retraining required by end-to-end methods. This work presents the
first fully pilot-free solution for joint channel estimation and source
recovery in block-fading MIMO systems. Extensive experiments show that
Blind-MIMOSC with PVD achieves superior channel and source recovery accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with drastically reduced channel
bandwidth ratio.

Conclusion: 所提出的分布式预编码框架在无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中实现了性能与开销的良好平衡，为下一代无线系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology
for next-generation wireless systems. The integration of cell-free massive MIMO
within the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture addresses the growing
need for decentralized, scalable, and high-capacity networks that can support
different use cases. Precoding is a crucial step in the operation of cell-free
massive MIMO, where O-RUs steer their beams towards the intended users while
mitigating interference to other users. Current precoding schemes for cell-free
massive MIMO are either fully centralized or fully distributed. Centralized
schemes are not scalable, whereas distributed schemes may lead to a high
inter-O-RU interference. In this paper, we propose a distributed and scalable
precoding framework for cell-free massive MIMO that uses limited information
exchange among precoding agents to mitigate interference. We formulate an
optimization problem for precoding that maximizes the aggregate throughput
while guaranteeing the minimum data rate requirements of users. The formulated
problem is nonconvex. We propose a multi-timescale framework that combines
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with expert insights from an
iterative algorithm to determine the precoding matrices efficiently. We conduct
simulations and compare the proposed framework with the centralized precoding
and distributed precoding methods for different numbers of O-RUs, users, and
transmit antennas. The results show that the proposed framework achieves a
higher aggregate throughput than the distributed regularized zero-forcing
(D-RZF) scheme and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm.
When compared with the centralized regularized zero-forcing (C-RZF) scheme, the
proposed framework achieves similar aggregate throughput performance but with a
lower signaling overhead.

Abstract: Protecting radio astronomy observatories from unintended interference is
critical as wireless transmissions increases near protected bands. While
database-driven coordination frameworks and radio quiet zones exist, they
cannot rapidly identify or suppress specific interfering transmitters,
especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. This paper presents the
first over-the-air field demonstration of Pseudonymetry at the Owens Valley
Radio Observatory (OVRO), illustrating cooperative spectrum sharing between
heterogeneous wireless systems. In our experiment, a narrow-band secondary
transmitter embeds a pseudonym watermark into its signal, while the wide-band
radio telescope passively extracts the watermark from spectrogram data. Results
show that interference can be reliably detected and the interfering device
uniquely identified even at low SNR where conventional demodulation is
infeasible. These findings validate that passive scientific receivers can
participate in a lightweight feedback loop to trigger shutdown of harmful
transmissions, demonstrating the potential of Pseudonymetry as a complementary
enforcement tool for protecting radio astronomy environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing multiband signals
from modulo-folded, pointwise samples within the Unlimited Sensing Framework

establish recovery guarantees demonstrating that sub-Nyquist sampling is
achievable under the USF paradigm. In doing so, we also tighten the previous
sampling theorem for bandpass signals. Our recovery algorithm demonstrates up
to a 13x dynamic range improvement in hardware experiments with up to 6
spectral bands. These results enable practical high-dynamic-range multiband
acquisition in scenarios previously limited by dynamic range and excessive

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of
next-generation wireless networks, enabling a wide range of emerging
applications such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), which operate in high-mobility scenarios. Notably, the wireless
channels within these applications typically exhibit severe delay and Doppler
spreads. The latter causes serious communication performance degradation in the
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform that is widely
adopted in current wireless networks. To address this challenge, the recently
proposed Doppler-resilient affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)
waveform, which uses flexible chirp signals as subcarriers, shows great
potential for achieving adaptive ISAC in high-mobility scenarios. This article
provides a comprehensive overview of AFDM-ISAC. We begin by presenting the
fundamentals of AFDM-ISAC, highlighting its inherent frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW)-like characteristics. Then, we explore its ISAC
performance limits by analyzing its diversity order, ambiguity function (AF),
and Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB). Finally, we present several effective sensing
algorithms and opportunities for AFDM-ISAC, with the aim of sparking new ideas
in this emerging field.

Abstract: In next-generation wireless systems, providing location-based mobile
computing services for energy-neutral devices has become a crucial objective
for the provision of sustainable Internet of Things (IoT). Visible light
positioning (VLP) has gained great research attention as a complementary method
to radio frequency (RF) solutions since it can leverage ubiquitous lighting
infrastructure. However, conventional VLP receivers often rely on
photodetectors or cameras that are power-hungry, complex, and expensive. To
address this challenge, we propose a hybrid indoor asset tracking system that
integrates visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC)
within a simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT)
framework. We design a low-complexity and energy-neutral IoT node, namely
backscatter device (BD) which harvests energy from light-emitting diode (LED)
access points, and then modulates and reflects ambient RF carriers to indicate
its location within particular VLC cells. We present a multi-cell VLC
deployment with frequency division multiplexing (FDM) method that mitigates
interference among LED access points by assigning them distinct frequency pairs
based on a four-color map scheduling principle. We develop a lightweight
particle filter (PF) tracking algorithm at an edge RF reader, where the fusion
of proximity reports and the received backscatter signal strength are employed
to track the BD. Experimental results show that this approach achieves the
positioning error of 0.318 m at 50th percentile and 0.634 m at 90th percentile,
while avoiding the use of complex photodetectors and active RF synthesizing
components at the energy-neutral IoT node. By demonstrating robust performance
in multiple indoor trajectories, the proposed solution enables scalable,
cost-effective, and energy-neutral indoor tracking for pervasive and
edge-assisted IoT applications.

Conclusion: 该研究充分展示了电磁神经网络和SIM辅助端到端CCFD系统在下一代收发器设计中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: To further suppress the inherent self-interference (SI) in co-frequency and
co-time full-duplex (CCFD) systems, we propose integrating a stacked
intelligent metasurface (SIM) into the RF front-end to enhance signal
processing in the wave domain. Furthermore, an end-to-end (E2E) learning-based
signal processing method is adopted to control the metasurface. Specifically,
the real metasurface is abstracted as hidden layers of a network, thereby
constructing an electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) to enable driving control
of the real communication system. Traditional communication tasks, such as
channel coding, modulation, precoding, combining, demodulation, and channel
decoding, are synchronously carried out during the electromagnetic (EM) forward
propagation through the metasurface. Simulation results show that, benefiting
from the additional wave-domain processing capability of the SIM, the
SIM-assisted CCFD system achieves significantly reduced bit error rate (BER)
compared with conventional CCFD systems. Our study fully demonstrates the
potential applications of EMNN and SIM-assisted E2E CCFD systems in
next-generation transceiver design.

Conclusion: 所提出的变分消息传递算法能够有效解决LEO卫星跟踪中的挑战，特别是在混合架构下的波束跟踪问题。

Abstract: Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems that use
millimeter-wave frequencies rely on large antenna arrays with hybrid
analog-digital architectures for rapid beam steering. LEO satellites are only
visible from the ground for short periods of times (a few tens of minutes) due
to their high orbital speeds. This paper presents a variational message passing
algorithm for joint localization and beam tracking of a LEO satellite from a
ground station equipped with a hybrid transceiver architecture. The algorithm
relies on estimating the parameters of the orbit, which is modelled as
circular. Angles are then obtained from the orbit in a straightforward manner.
Simulation results show that the proposed method is highly resilient to missed
detections, enables reliable satellite tracking even near the horizon, and
effectively alleviates the ambiguities inherent in hybrid architectures.

Abstract: This article investigates how the creeping wave propagation around the human
thigh could be used to monitor the leg movements. The propagation path around
the human thigh gives information regarding leg motions that can be used for
the classification of activities. The variation of the transmission coefficient
is measured between two on-body polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible
antennas for six different leg-based activities that exhibit unique
time-varying signatures. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) along with
different classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), decision trees,
naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), is applied for feature extraction
and classification to evaluate the efficiency for classifying different
activity signals. Additional algorithms, such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), have also been implemented, and in
each case, SVM with DWT outperforms the others. Simulation to evaluate a
specific absorption rate (SAR) is carried out as the antenna is positioned on
the human thigh leaving no gap. The results show that the SAR is within the
threshold as per the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) standard.

Abstract: Early fault diagnosis is imperative for the proper functioning of rotating
machines. It can reduce economic losses in the industry due to unexpected
failures. Existing fault analysis methods are either expensive or demand
expertise for the installation of the sensors. This article proposes a novel
method for the detection of bearing faults and imbalance in induction motors
using an antenna as the sensor, which is noninvasive and cost-efficient.
Time-varying S11 is measured using an omnidirectional antenna, and it is seen
that the spectrogram of S11 shows unique characteristics for different fault
conditions. The experimental setup has analytically evaluated the vibration
frequencies due to fault and validated the characteristic fault frequency by
applying FFT analysis on the captured S11 data. This article has evaluated the
average power content of the detected signals at normal and different fault
conditions. A deep learning model is used to classify the faults based on the
reflection coefficient ( S11). It is found that classification accuracy of
98.2% is achieved using both magnitude and phase of S11, 96% using the
magnitude of S11 and 92.1% using the phase of S11. The classification accuracy
for different operating frequencies, antenna location, and time windows are
also investigated.

Motivation: 解决混合视距/非视距场景下的定位问题，结合模型方法和信道制图的优势，实现无监督学习下的高精度定位。

Conclusion: UNILocPro和UNILoc框架在混合LoS/NLoS场景下实现了高精度定位，UNILocPro在无监督条件下达到监督方法性能，UNILoc在保持性能的同时显著降低复杂度。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified localization framework (called UNILocPro)
that integrates model-based localization and channel charting (CC) for mixed
line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. Specifically, based on
LoS/NLoS identification, an adaptive activation between the model-based and
CC-based methods is conducted. Aiming for unsupervised learning, information
obtained from the model-based method is utilized to train the CC model, where a
pairwise distance loss (involving a new dissimilarity metric design), a triplet
loss (if timestamps are available), a LoS-based loss, and an optimal transport
(OT)-based loss are jointly employed such that the global geometry can be well
preserved. To reduce the training complexity of UNILocPro, we propose a
low-complexity implementation (called UNILoc), where the CC model is trained
with self-generated labels produced by a single pre-training OT transformation,
which avoids iterative Sinkhorn updates involved in the OT-based loss
computation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
unified frameworks achieve significantly improved positioning accuracy compared
to both model-based and CC-based methods. Notably, UNILocPro with timestamps
attains performance on par with fully-supervised fingerprinting despite
operating without labelled training data. It is also shown that the
low-complexity UNILoc can substantially reduce training complexity with only
marginal performance degradation.

Conclusion: 激光扫描技术结合机器学习方法能有效估算热带干旱森林地上生物量，为巴黎协定要求的碳监测提供可靠工具。

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to
submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years
by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon
emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the
significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate
change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality
forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground
biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the
least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for
accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis
of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning
datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches
SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning
were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable
selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning
approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results
indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,
Elev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are
important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,
canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy
emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent
tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02
Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across
all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in
estimating total biomass per plot.

Method: 使用RNN基于历史测量生成高斯先验，通过重参数化技巧进行粒子采样来估计非线性测量下的状态后验统计量，避免了计算密集的序列蒙特卡洛方法。

Result: 在随机Lorenz-63系统上测试了四种非线性测量系统，包括三次非线性、相机模型非线性、半波整流非线性和笛卡尔到球坐标非线性。状态估计性能与完全了解状态转移模型的粒子滤波器相当。

Conclusion: pDANSE方法能够有效处理模型未知过程和非线性测量系统的状态估计问题，性能与已知模型的传统方法相当，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation
(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose
underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred
to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides
parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free
process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of
DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for
the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system
renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics
of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed
at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a
reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the
second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred
to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential
measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive
sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the
semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised
learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system
as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation
performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic
nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is
used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and
Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The
performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle
filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.

Unfortunately, solutions of this nature can often fail to fully capture the

TL;DR: 提出了多跳并行图像语义通信框架（MHPSC），通过在每个跳段引入并行残差补偿链路来解决多跳无线图像传输中的失真累积问题，并设计了粗到细的残差压缩方案来最小化传输带宽开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义通信方案主要关注单跳场景，忽视了多跳无线图像传输的挑战。由于语义通信本质上是失真的，失真会在多跳中累积，导致显著的性能下降。

Method: 提出MHPSC框架，在每个跳段引入并行残差补偿链路对抗失真累积。设计了粗到细的残差压缩方案：深度学习残差压缩器首先压缩残差，然后使用自适应算术编码（AAC）进一步压缩。残差分布估计模块预测AAC的先验分布以实现精细压缩性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，MHPSC在仅轻微增加传输带宽的情况下，优于现有的语义通信和传统分离编码方案。

Conclusion: MHPSC框架能够确保鲁棒的多跳图像传输，有效解决了语义通信在多跳场景中的失真累积问题。

Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop
scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission.
As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over
multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this,
we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC)
framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop
against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission
bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A
deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed
by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual
distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to
achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop
image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth.
Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic
communication and traditional separated coding schemes.

Abstract: Cellular intelligence enables cells to process environmental signals and make
context-dependent decisions, as exemplified by chemotaxis, where cells navigate
chemical gradients despite noisy signaling pathways. To investigate how cells
deal with uncertainty, we apply an information-theoretic framework based on
rate distortion theory (RDT). The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA) computes
optimal decision strategies that minimize mutual information while satisfying
distortion constraints, balancing sensing accuracy with distortion constraint
equivalent to resource cost. We propose the inverse Blahut-Arimoto algorithm
(IBAA) to compute the distortion function, which quantifies the system's
decision-making criteria for realizing a decision strategy to map input signals
to outputs. This general framework extends beyond chemotaxis to biological and
engineered systems requiring efficient information processing under
uncertainty. We validate the proposed IBAA by accurately estimating theoretical
distortion functions in a cellular apoptosis scenario. Additionally, using the
local excitation global inhibition (LEGI) model to simulate chemotactic
responses, we compute the distortion functions from the cell's perspective. Our
finding reveals a state-dependent decision criteria by the cell.

Abstract: Constant dimension codes (CDCs) have become an important object in coding
theory due to their application in random network coding. The multilevel
construction is one of the most effective ways to construct constant dimension
codes. The paper is devoted to constructing CDCs by the multilevel
construction. Precisely, we first choose an appropriate skeleton code based on
the transformations of binary vectors related to the one-factorization of
complete graphs; then we construct CDCs by using the chosen skeleton code,
where quasi-pending blocks are used; finally, we calculate the dimensions by
use of known constructions of optimal Ferrers diagram rank metric codes. As
applications, we improve the lower bounds of $\overline{A}_q(n,8,6)$ for
$16\leq n\leq 19.$

Abstract: We pay our attention towards secure and robust communication in the presence
of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced mobile eavesdropping
attacker in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)wireless
networks.Specifically,we first provide a unifying framework that generalizes
specific intelligent wiretap model wherein the passive eavesdropper configured
with any number of antennas is potentially mobile and can actively optimize its
received signal strength with the help of RIS by intelligently manipulating
wiretap channel characteristics.To effectively mitigate this intractable
threat,we then propose a novel and lightweight secure communication scheme from
the perspective of information theory.The main idea is that the data processing
can in some cases be observed as communication channel,and a random
bit-flipping scheme is then carefully involved for the legitimate transmitter
to minimize the mutual information between the secret message and the passive
eavesdropper's received data.The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based
precoding strategy is also implemented to optimize power allocation,and thus
ensure that the legitimate receiver is not subject to interference from this
random bit-flipping.The corresponding results depict that our secure
communication scheme is practically desired, which does not require any a prior
knowledge of the eavesdropper's full instantaneous Channel State Information
(ICSI). Furthermore,we consider the RIS optimization problem from the
eavesdropper's perspective,and provide RIS phase shift design solutions under
different attacking scenarios.Finally,the optimal detection schemes
respectively for the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are provided,and
comprehensive simulations are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and
show the effectiveness and robustness of our secure communication scheme across
a wide range of attacking scenarios.

Conclusion: 成功减轻了对全局瞬时信道状态信息和决策融合规则的依赖，使信道感知方法更加实用，并通过广泛模拟验证了理论分析。

Abstract: From the perspective of hard decision fusion, we investigate Byzantine
attacks in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) for mobile
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in this paper. Specially, a RIS-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted CSS configuration is first constructed under
dynamic channel scenarios due to user mobility. Subsequently, the channel- and
attack-aware hard decision fusion rules are developed, and the optimal
channel-aware Byzantine attack strategies are then developed under both
small-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios. The corresponding results
depict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge
of the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm
probability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although
perfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker
perspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward
relays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that
leads to fast fading channels. Furthermore, our counterintuitive results also
indicate that, regardless of the attacker's awareness of the decision fusion
rule, the optimal Byzantine attack can be achieved through a unifying
framework, the explicit attack strategy may be not unique, and the attacking
effectiveness is primarily determined by the fraction of the Byzantine nodes
rather than the channel dynamics. That is, to make the channel-aware approach
more practical, the challenge that the heavy reliance on the global ICSI and
decision fusion rule in obtaining the Byzantine attacks is successfully
relaxed. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis through
extensive simulations across a wide range of attacking scenarios.

Main category: cs.IT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蜂窝和无蜂窝架构在能效方面存在局限，需要开发更高效的天线部署策略来提升系统性能。

Method: 采用双尺度部署框架，包含粗调和精调两个阶段，提出四种部署协议，并设计基于惩罚的交替优化算法解决非凸耦合问题。

Result: 仿真验证了理论结果的准确性，PASS相比传统无蜂窝架构能效提升约70%，相比MIMO系统提升近两倍。

Conclusion: 双尺度部署框架能显著提升系统能效，部署分辨率和协议的选择对实现最大能效至关重要。

Abstract: A dual-scale deployment (DSD) framework for pinching antenna systems (PASS)
is proposed. 1) In the first coarse stage, the pinching antenna (PA) is
transferred over a large-scale range at the waveguide level. 2) The refinement
stage performs small-scale relocation of the PA with high precision. Four PA
deployment protocols are provided in the proposed DSD framework. Then, a
practical power consumption model is proposed, based on which the theoretical
energy efficiency formulas for PASS are derived. The transmit precoding, PA
radiation power, and PA deployment are jointly optimized to maximize the energy
efficiency under the provided PA deployment protocols. To solve this
non-convex, highly coupled problem, a low-complexity penalty-based alternating
optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of
theoretical results and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is
demonstrated that: 1) PASS delivers about 70% higher energy efficiency than the
conventional cell-free architecture and nearly twofold improvement relative to
MIMO systems; 2) it is essential to specify the DSD resolution and deployment
protocol to achieve the maximum energy efficiency for PASS.

Conclusion: CIR-UNext为跨频段预测提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，支持6G网络中的定位、波束管理、数字孪生和智能资源分配等应用。

Abstract: Accurate cross-band channel prediction is essential for 6G networks,
particularly in the upper mid-band (FR3, 7--24 GHz), where penetration loss and
blockage are severe. Although ray tracing (RT) provides high-fidelity modeling,
it remains computationally intensive, and high-frequency data acquisition is
costly. To address these challenges, we propose CIR-UNext, a deep learning
framework designed to predict 7 GHz channel impulse responses (CIRs) by
leveraging abundant 3.5 GHz CIRs. The framework integrates an RT-based dataset
pipeline with attention U-Net (AU-Net) variants for gain and phase prediction.
The proposed AU-Net-Aux model achieves a median gain error of 0.58 dB and a
phase prediction error of 0.27 rad on unseen complex environments. Furthermore,
we extend CIR-UNext into a foundation model, Channel2ComMap, for throughput
prediction in MIMO-OFDM systems, demonstrating superior performance compared
with existing approaches. Overall, CIR-UNext provides an efficient and scalable
solution for cross-band prediction, enabling applications such as localization,
beam management, digital twins, and intelligent resource allocation in 6G
networks.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider codes over finite fields, finite abelian groups,
and finite Frobenius rings. For such codes, the complete weight enumerator and
the Hamming weight enumerator serve as powerful tools. These two types of
weight enumerators satisfy the MacWilliams relations. We define the weight
enumerator of a code with respect to an equivalence relation and determine in
which cases the MacWilliams relations hold for this weight enumerator. We also
study some weight enumerators for specific equivalence relations.
