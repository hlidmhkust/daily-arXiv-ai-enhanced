### [1] [STROKEVISION-BENCH: A Multimodal Video And 2D Pose Benchmark For Tracking Stroke Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07994)
*David Robinson,Animesh Gupta,Rizwan Quershi,Qiushi Fu,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 首个专门针对中风患者执行临床结构化方块转移任务的数据集StrokeVision-Bench，包含1000个标注视频，用于客观评估上肢运动功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前中风康复评估主要依赖主观观察和粗糙评分系统，缺乏检测细微运动改善的敏感性。现有数据集主要关注日常生活活动，缺乏临床结构化评估任务。

Method: 收集1000个标注视频，分为四个临床相关动作类别，提供原始视频帧和2D骨骼关键点两种模态。对多种先进的视频动作识别和基于骨骼的动作分类方法进行基准测试。

Result: 建立了该领域的性能基准，为未来自动化中风康复评估研究提供基础。

Conclusion: StrokeVision-Bench填补了临床结构化评估数据集的空白，为客观、量化和可扩展的上肢运动功能评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of
upper extremity (UE) function after stroke largely remains subjective, relying
heavily on therapist observation and coarse scoring systems. This subjectivity
limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements,
which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in
computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative,
and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box
and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity
and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself
well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke
rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to
capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks.
Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and
stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility.
To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever
dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block
transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized
into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in
two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark
several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action
classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and
facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

*Yin Li,Sean Korphi,Sam Shiu,Yasuo Morimoto,Jiang Zhu,Rajalakshimi Nandakumar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BodyWave是一个基于毫米波雷达的自我中心身体追踪系统，相比摄像头方案具有非视距检测、低功耗、隐私保护等优势，在MR应用中实现了与最先进摄像头系统相当的追踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统摄像头自我中心身体追踪存在的视角受限、遮挡严重、隐私问题等挑战，为混合现实应用提供更鲁棒和隐私保护的替代方案。

Method: 使用毫米波雷达处理原始信号生成高分辨率距离剖面图，预测身体关键点的细粒度3D坐标，原型设计模仿Meta Quest 3形态，雷达距离面部仅4cm。

Result: 在14名参与者的用户研究中，收集约50万帧数据，未见过用户的平均关节位置误差为9.85cm，几分钟用户校准后降至4.94cm，完全适配用户依赖设置下达到3.86cm。

Conclusion: BodyWave系统在保持与最先进摄像头系统相当精度的同时，提供了更鲁棒、隐私保护的自我中心身体追踪解决方案，显著推进了雷达基IOBT的实用性。

Abstract: Egocentric body tracking, also known as inside-out body tracking (IOBT), is
an essential technology for applications like gesture control and codec avatar
in mixed reality (MR), including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality
(VR). However, it is more challenging than exocentric body tracking due to the
limited view angles of camera-based solutions, which provide only sparse and
self-occluded input from head-mounted cameras, especially for lower-body parts.
To address these challenges, we propose, BodyWave, an IOBT system based on
millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, which can detect non-line-of-sight. It offers
low SWAP+C (size, weight, and power consumption), robustness to environmental
and user factors, and enhanced privacy over camera-based solutions. Our
prototype, modeled after the Meta Quest 3 form factor, places radars just 4cm
away from the face, which significantly advances the practicality of
radar-based IOBT. We tackle the sparsity issue of mmWave radar by processing
the raw signal into high-resolution range profiles to predict fine-grained 3D
coordinates of body keypoints. In a user study with 14 participants and around
500,000 frames of collected data, we achieved a mean per-joint position error
(MPJPE) of 9.85 cm on unseen users, 4.94 cm with a few minutes of user
calibration, and 3.86 cm in a fully-adapted user-dependent setting. This is
comparable to state-of-the-art camera-based IOBT systems, introducing a robust
and privacy-preserving alternative for MR applications.

### [3] [Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning for Medical Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08007)
*Ifrat Ikhtear Uddin,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出专家引导的可解释少样本学习框架，通过整合放射科医生提供的ROI区域和Dice相似度解释损失，在提升分类性能的同时增强模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析面临专家标注数据稀缺的问题，限制了模型泛化能力和临床应用。需要同时提升少样本学习性能和模型可解释性。

Method: 结合Grad-CAM空间注意力监督，引入基于Dice相似度的解释损失，与原型网络目标联合优化，使模型关注临床相关区域。

Result: 在BraTS(MRI)数据集上准确率从77.09%提升至83.61%，在VinDr-CXR(胸部X光)数据集上从54.33%提升至73.29%。Grad-CAM可视化证实注意力与诊断区域更好对齐。

Conclusion: 专家引导的注意力监督能有效弥合少样本医学图像诊断中性能与可解释性之间的差距，提高预测可靠性和临床可信度。

Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited
expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical
adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework
that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model
training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and
interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we
introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention
with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is
jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging
the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data
conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and
VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from
77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to
non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided
training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both
predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to
bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical
image diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 深度学习自动化工具用于计算脑缩羅指数，在老年患者CT扫描中验证了与人工评分的一致性，并与年龄和认知功能相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前脑缩羅量化需要耗时的视觉评分标准，需要自动化的脑图像分析工具来提高效率

Method: 开发深度学习工具测量全脑缩羅指数(GCA)，在老年患者CT扫描数据集上训练和验证，与训练有素的人类评分者进行对比

Result: 深度学习工具与主要评分者的均绝对误差为3.2，半数样本错误范围在-2到2之间，与人类评分者的一致性超过人类评分者之间的一致性

Conclusion: 该深度学习工具能够准确地在真实世界医疗场景中测量脑缩羅指数，无需人工干预，为大规模健康数据研究提供标准化的缩羅量化指标

Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which
are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We
validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral
Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and
cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain
scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke
(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for
training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained
raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL
tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated
using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans
(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and
rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6
for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.
Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41
between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and
rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two
raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and
rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)
or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated
with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool
measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans
acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised
quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and
will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前生成模型在可控性和解剖学真实性之间的权衡问题，为临床研究和医疗设备设计提供更好的结构-功能关系研究工具

Method: 使用嵌入3D空间的可解释椭球体原语来引导无条件扩散模型，通过在多组织分割图中选择特定组织并应用几何矩损失来指导反向扩散过程

Result: 实现了对尺寸、形状、位置以及多组件约束组合的独立控制

Conclusion: 该框架为解剖学生成模型提供了更好的可控性和解剖学真实性，有助于临床研究和医疗设备设计

Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators,
enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and
medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between
controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and
compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human
anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our
method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue
segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the
reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over
size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component
constraints during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在解码器已有3D点云几何信息的情况下，如何有效进行有损属性压缩，利用多分辨率B样条投影框架来提升压缩效率。

Method: 将目标连续3D属性函数投影到嵌套子空间序列，使用B样条基函数展开，通过率失真优化算法展开为前馈网络计算低通系数，采用稀疏促进的ℓ1范数作为率项，实现端到端可微的投影操作，并通过数据驱动方式优化从低分辨率到高分辨率的预测调整。

Result: 提出了一种端到端可微的多分辨率B样条投影压缩框架，能够有效实现3D点云属性的有损压缩。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合多分辨率B样条投影和率失真优化，为3D点云属性压缩提供了一种有效的端到端可微解决方案，具有较好的压缩性能。

Abstract: Given encoded 3D point cloud geometry available at the decoder, we study the
problem of lossy attribute compression in a multi-resolution B-spline
projection framework. A target continuous 3D attribute function is first
projected onto a sequence of nested subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0}
\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{L}$, where
$\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l}$ is a family of functions spanned by a B-spline basis
function of order $p$ at a chosen scale and its integer shifts. The projected
low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$ are computed by variable-complexity unrolling of
a rate-distortion (RD) optimization algorithm into a feed-forward network,
where the rate term is the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm. Thus, the
projection operation is end-to-end differentiable. For a chosen coarse-to-fine
predictor, the coefficients are then adjusted to account for the prediction
from a lower-resolution to a higher-resolution, which is also optimized in a
data-driven manner.

Method: 提出聚合转移学习(FTL)框架，利用预训练模型和知识转移技术，在云服务器与数字双生CT扫描仪之间实现实时协作，同时保护患者隐私。

Result: 在异质性CT扫描数据集上评估，FTL方法在模型准确度、精度、召回率、F1分数等指标上都表现优于传统聚合学习和聚类聚合学习方法，尤其在非IID数据环境下显示出优异性能。

Conclusion: FTL技术为医学诊断提供了可靠、高效和安全的解决方案，有助于提升数字双生基于CT扫描分析的决策能力，促进隐私保护，为精准医学和智慧医疗系统的应用开启新可能。

Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve
decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient
medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for
applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

### [8] [Physics-Guided Rectified Flow for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08330)
*Juntai Zeng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging
task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from
using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic
datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but
existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative
components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level
manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately
reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a
noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low
illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive
and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per
pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes
noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of
traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced
by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong
performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we
further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow
generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework
for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows
to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the
generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark
captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image
enhancement.

TL;DR: 基于专门设计的神经网络模型，通过利用角度-空间-谱域多维冗余性来有效降低多光谱CT投影数据的噪声，同时保持细细结构细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱CT由于光子在多个能量筛中分布导致每个能量筛的光子计数减少，产生强噪声，需要有效的降噪方法来提升图像质量和缩短扫描时间

Method: 使用专门设计的神经网络模型，通过堆叠汇总和注意力机制结合专门子网络，利用角度-空间域的非局部相似性和谱域相邻能量带的相关性

Result: 在BM18光束线设备的模拟数据上训练，对高Z和低Z材料幻象进行验证，降噪后的投影和重建图像质量显著提升，超过传统方法和基准CNN模型

Conclusion: 该方法在广泛的谱范围内实现了优异性能，能够有效地渗透到真实实验数据，在显著降低噪声的同时保持结构保真度

Abstract: Multispectral computed tomography (CT) enables advanced material
characterization by acquiring energy-resolved projection data. However, since
the incoming X-ray flux is be distributed across multiple narrow energy bins,
the photon count per bin is greatly reduced compared to standard
energy-integrated imaging. This inevitably introduces substantial noise, which
can either prolong acquisition times and make scan durations infeasible or
degrade image quality with strong noise artifacts. To address this challenge,
we present a dedicated neural network-based denoising approach tailored for
multispectral CT projections acquired at the BM18 beamline of the ESRF. The
method exploits redundancies across angular, spatial, and spectral domains
through specialized sub-networks combined via stacked generalization and an
attention mechanism. Non-local similarities in the angular-spatial domain are
leveraged alongside correlations between adjacent energy bands in the spectral
domain, enabling robust noise suppression while preserving fine structural
details. Training was performed exclusively on simulated data replicating the
physical and noise characteristics of the BM18 setup, with validation conducted
on CT scans of custom-designed phantoms containing both high-Z and low-Z
materials. The denoised projections and reconstructions demonstrate substantial
improvements in image quality compared to classical denoising methods and
baseline CNN models. Quantitative evaluations confirm that the proposed method
achieves superior performance across a broad spectral range, generalizing
effectively to real-world experimental data while significantly reducing noise
without compromising structural fidelity.

Abstract: This research explored the hybridization of CNN and ViT within a training
dataset of limited size, and introduced a distinct class imbalance. The
training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and
experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid
model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced
and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model,
complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of
0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85,
suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in
outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex
architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all
data fractions.

TL;DR: RoentMod是一个反事实图像编辑框架，通过生成解剖学真实的胸部X光片来检测和纠正医学AI中的捷径学习问题，提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光片是医学中最常见的检查之一，深度学习模型在解读时容易依赖虚假相关性而非临床相关特征进行决策（捷径学习），需要工具来检测和纠正这种脆弱性。

Method: 结合开源医学图像生成器(RoentGen)和图像到图像修改模型，无需重新训练即可生成具有用户指定合成病理的解剖学真实CXRs，同时保留原始扫描的无关解剖特征。

Result: RoentMod生成的图像在93%情况下看起来真实，89-99%正确包含指定发现，解剖结构保存与真实随访CXRs相当。使用RoentMod训练可将模型区分度提高3-19% AUC。

Conclusion: RoentMod是检测和纠正医学AI中捷径学习的广泛应用工具，通过受控反事实干预增强CXR解读模型的鲁棒性和可解释性，为医学影像基础模型改进提供通用策略。

Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine.
Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand
access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models
have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to
shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations
rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce
RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically
realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving
unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an
open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image
modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with
board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images
appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified
finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real
follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task
and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,
limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual
images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model
discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation
and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These
findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and
correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled
counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and
interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable
strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的空间-光谱色彩编码方法，用于SAR图像中干扰模式的可视化分析，通过光谱子带分解和RGB/HSV双空间编码，将干扰特性转化为可视模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAR灰度图像难以显式显示外部无线电发射器和未聚焦信号引起的干扰特性，需要一种能够直观揭示这些干扰模式的可视化方法。

Method: 首先通过光谱子带分解生成一系列空间-光谱图像，然后使用专门设计的调色板进行RGB/HSV双空间色彩编码，将空间-光谱特性编码为可视觉辨别的模式。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效突出干扰区域和未聚焦回波或信号响应（如模糊、模糊和移动目标效应），为SAR图像的视觉解释、质量评估和数据诊断提供实用工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为SAR图像分析提供了一种无需额外处理的快速视觉解释工具，能够直观显示干扰特性，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are conventionally visualized as
grayscale amplitude representations, which often fail to explicitly reveal
interference characteristics caused by external radio emitters and unfocused
signals. This paper proposes a novel spatial-spectral chromatic coding method
for visual analysis of interference patterns in single-look complex (SLC) SAR
imagery. The method first generates a series of spatial-spectral images via
spectral subband decomposition that preserve both spatial structures and
spectral signatures. These images are subsequently chromatically coded into a
color representation using RGB/HSV dual-space coding, using a set of
specifically designed color palette. This method intrinsically encodes the
spatial-spectral properties of interference into visually discernible patterns,
enabling rapid visual interpretation without additional processing. To
facilitate physical interpretation, mathematical models are established to
theoretically analyze the physical mechanisms of responses to various
interference types. Experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the method
effectively highlights interference regions and unfocused echo or signal
responses (e.g., blurring, ambiguities, and moving target effects), providing
analysts with a practical tool for visual interpretation, quality assessment,
and data diagnosis in SAR imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FORCES成像技术虽然能提高信噪比和穿透深度，但对运动敏感，传统方法容易产生运动伪影。

Method: 采用递归孔径解码(READI)技术从FORCES序列中生成多个低分辨率图像，通过运动估计补偿(EMC2)进行运动补偿和相干复合。

Result: READI with EMC2能完全恢复因探头运动而损坏的图像，恢复心脏跳动图像的组织斑点和清晰度，低分辨率图像本身也优于相同发射次数的稀疏STA方案。

Conclusion: READI技术有效解决了FORCES成像的运动敏感问题，在保持高图像质量的同时提高了运动鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) is a Hadamard-encoded
Synthetic Transmit Aperture (STA) imaging sequence using bias-sensitive
Top-Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) arrays. It produces images with a
higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and improved penetration depth compared to
traditional STA techniques, but suffers from motion sensitivity due to ensemble
size and aperture encoding. This work presents Recursive Aperture Decoded
Ultrasound Imaging (READI), a novel decoding and beamforming technique for
FORCES that produces multiple low-resolution images out of subsets of the
FORCES sequence that are less susceptible to motion, but sum to form the
complete FORCES image. Estimated Motion-Compensated Compounding (EMC2)
describes the process of comparing these low-resolution images to estimate the
underlying motion, then warping them to align before coherent compounding.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a wearable wireless resonator glasses design
that enhances eye MRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without compromising
whole-brain image quality at 7 T.
  Methods: The device integrates two detunable LC loop resonators into a
lightweight, 3D-printed frame positioned near the eyes. The resonators
passively couple to a standard 2Tx/32Rx head coil without hardware
modifications. Bench tests assessed tuning, isolation, and detuning
performance. B1$^+$ maps were measured in a head/shoulder phantom, and SNR maps
were obtained in both phantom and in vivo experiments.
  Results: Bench measurements confirmed accurate tuning, strong inter-element
isolation, and effective passive detuning. Phantom B1$^+$ mapping showed
negligible differences between configurations with and without the resonators.
Phantom and in vivo imaging demonstrated up to about a 3-fold SNR gain in the
eye region, with no measurable SNR loss in the brain.
  Conclusion: The wireless resonator glasses provide a low-cost, easy-to-use
solution that improves ocular SNR while preserving whole-brain image quality,
enabling both dedicated eye MRI and simultaneous eye-brain imaging at ultrahigh

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the construction industry depends on
precise and prompt recognition of human motion intentions and actions by robots
to maximize safety and workflow efficiency. There is a research gap in
comparing data modalities, specifically signals and videos, for motion
intention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to
assess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the
early stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface
electromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average
time of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the
pre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed
video sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy
of 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction.
This study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats,
directing their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world
construction projects.

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for
next-generation wireless systems, improving the communication efficiency by
transmitting high-level semantic features. However, reliance on unimodal
representations can degrade reconstruction under poor channel conditions, and
privacy concerns of the semantic information attack also gain increasing
attention. In this work, a privacy-preserving semantic communication framework
is proposed to protect sensitive content of the image data. Leveraging a
vision-language model (VLM), the proposed framework identifies and removes
private content regions from input images prior to transmission. A shared
privacy database enables semantic alignment between the transmitter and
receiver to ensure consistent identification of sensitive entities. At the
receiver, a generative module reconstructs the masked regions using learned
semantic priors and conditioned on the received text embedding. Simulation
results show that generalizes well to unseen image processing tasks, improves
reconstruction quality at the authorized receiver by over 10% using text
embedding, and reduces identity leakage to the eavesdropper by more than 50%.

Motivation: 传统的LC交叉器和数字滤波器在能量效率、相位一致性和组件容差耐受性方面存在缺陷，需要一种更优科的硬件辅助滤波解决方案。

Method: 设计了Resonant Transformer Router (RTR)无损交叉方法，其频响响应满足线性互补关系HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1，通过理论推导和电路模拟验证其性能。

Result: RTR在能量效率、相位一致性和组件容差耐受性方面表现优于传统LC交叉器和数字FIR/IIR滤波器，提供低损耗、低延迟的解决方案。

Conclusion: RTR无损交叉方法为高保真音频和通信前端提供了一种优科的硬件辅助滤波解决方案，基于中国专利CN116318117A开发并进行了扩展。

Abstract: This paper proposes a transformer-based lossless crossover method, termed
Resonant Transformer Router (RTR), which achieves frequency separation while
ensuring perfect phase alignment between low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency
(HF) channels at the crossover frequency. The core property of RTR is that its
frequency responses satisfy a linear complementary relation HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1. so
that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed by linear summation of
the two channels. Theoretical derivation and circuit simulations demonstrate
that RTR provides superior energy efficiency, phase consistency, and robustness
against component tolerances. Compared with conventional LC crossovers and
digital FIR/IIR filters, RTR offers a low-loss, low-latency hardware-assisted
filtering solution suitable for high-fidelity audio and communication
front-ends.
  The core theory behind this paper's work, lossless crossover, is based on a

the authors, Jianluan Li. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation of
this theory and propose a new extension.

Abstract: Conventional digital beamforming for wideband multiuser orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) demands numerous power-hungry
components, increasing hardware costs and complexity. By contrast, the stacked
intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) can perform wave-based precoding at near-light
speed, drastically reducing baseband overhead. However, realizing SIM-enhanced
fully-analog beamforming for wideband multiuser transmissions remains
challenging, as the SIM configuration has to handle interference across all
subcarriers. To address this, this paper proposes a flexible subcarrier
allocation strategy to fully reap the SIM-assisted fully-analog beamforming
capability in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system,
where each subcarrier selectively serves one or more users to balance
interference mitigation and resource utilization of SIM. We propose an
iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment matrix and
SIM transmission coefficients, approximating an interference-free channel for
those selected subcarriers. Results show that the proposed system has low
fitting errors yet allows each user to exploit more subcarriers. Further
comparisons highlight a fundamental trade-off: our system achieves near-zero
interference and robust data reliability without incurring the hardware burdens
of digital precoding.

Abstract: For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional
designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees
of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable
to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework
that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise
(AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple
eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN
precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by
taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping
locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and
the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust
algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers,
whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In
addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode
and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are
applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes
boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power,
while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the
synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of
their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and
reliability under limited resources.

Abstract: Plants exchange information through multiple modalities, including chemical,
electrical, mycorrhizal, and acoustic signaling, which collectively support
survival, defense, and adaptation. While these processes are well documented in
biology, their systematic analysis from an Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) perspective remains limited. To address this gap, this article

biological background, reformulates inter-plant signaling within ICT
frameworks, and surveys empirical studies to guide future research and
applications. First, the paper introduces the fundamental biological processes
to establish a foundation for readers in communications and networking.
Building on this foundation, existing models of emission, propagation, and
reception are synthesized for each modality and reformulated in terms of
transmitter, channel, and receiver blocks. To complement theory, empirical
studies and state-of-the-art sensing approaches are critically examined.
Looking forward, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future

Motivation: D波段频率(110-170GHz)是5G/6G ISAC系统的有前景候选频段，但相位噪声是该频段的关键损伤，需要评估其对ISAC传感性能的实际影响。

Method: 使用硬件调谐的3GPP相位噪声模型在130GHz频段，采用480kHz numerology的OFDM系统，通过FFT雷达处理评估ISAC传感性能。

Result: 相位噪声导致距离RMSE平台为0.04-0.05m，速度RMSE平台为0.12-0.18m/s，多普勒旁瓣指标饱和(PSLR约-6dB，ISLR约-4dB)。距离精度仍受带宽限制，而速度估计和旁瓣抑制对相位噪声敏感。

Conclusion: 研究强调了相位噪声感知波形和numerology设计对sub-THz ISAC的重要性，为未来多波段收发器提供了见解，通信指标和相位噪声缓解策略留待未来研究。

Abstract: Phase noise (PN) is a critical impairment at D-band frequencies (110 to 170
GHz), which are widely investigated as promising candidates for beyond 5G/6G
ISAC systems. This paper evaluates OFDM based ISAC sensing performance under
realistic oscillator impairments using a hardware-tuned 3GPP PN model at 130
GHz and FFT based radar processing. With a numerology of 480 kHz, results show
that PN introduces range RMSE floors of 0.04 to 0.05 m and velocity RMSE floors
of 0.12 to 0.18 m/s. Doppler sidelobe metrics also saturate, with PSLR around
minus 6 dB and ISLR around minus 4 dB. These findings confirm that range
accuracy remains bandwidth limited, while velocity estimation and sidelobe
suppression are strongly PN-sensitive. The study highlights the importance of
PN-aware waveform and numerology design for sub-THz ISAC and provides insights
for future multi-band transceivers. Communication metrics and PN mitigation
strategies such as PTRS and CPE tracking are left for future work.

Abstract: Recent trends in learning wireless policies attempt to develop deep neural
networks (DNNs) for handling multiple tasks with a single model. Existing
approaches often rely on large models, which are hard to pre-train and
fine-tune at the wireless edge. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by
leveraging the structured knowledge of wireless problems -- specifically,
permutation equivariant (PE) properties. We design three types of PE-aware
modules, two of which are Transformer-style sub-layers. These modules can serve
as building blocks to assemble compact DNNs applicable to the wireless policies
with various PE properties. To guide the design, we analyze the hypothesis
space associated with each PE property, and show that the PE-structured module
assembly can boost the learning efficiency. Inspired by the reusability of the
modules, we propose PE-MoFormer, a compositional DNN capable of learning a wide
range of wireless policies -- including but not limited to precoding,
coordinated beamforming, power allocation, and channel estimation -- with
strong generalizability, low sample and space complexity. Simulations
demonstrate that the proposed modular PE-based framework outperforms relevant
large model in both learning efficiency and inference time, offering a new
direction for structured cross-task learning for wireless communications.

Conclusion: 所提出的波束成形框架有效解决了近场ISAC系统中多目标感知问题，特别是在视距阻塞情况下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Enabling multi-target sensing in near-field integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) systems is a key challenge, particularly when
line-of-sight paths are blocked. This paper proposes a beamforming framework
that leverages a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve
multi-target indication. Our contribution is the extension of classic
beampattern gain and inter-target cross-correlation metrics to the near-field,
leveraging both angle and distance information to discriminate between multiple
users and targets. We formulate a problem to maximize the worst-case sensing
performance by jointly designing the beamforming at the base station and the
phase shifts at the RIS, while guaranteeing communication rates. The non-convex
problem is solved via an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that
utilizes semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Simulations demonstrate that our
RIS-assisted framework enables high-resolution sensing of co-angle targets in
blocked scenarios.

Conclusion: LRC通道为软决策解码提供了一种可分析的数学框架，能够量化地评估软决策的性能优势，并为软决策编码设计开启了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a discrete soft-decision channel called the linear
reliability channel (LRC) in which the soft information is the rank ordering of
the received symbol reliabilities. We prove that the LRC is an appropriate
approximation to a general class of discrete modulation, continuous noise
channels when the noise variance is high. The central feature of the LRC is
that its combinatorial nature allows for an extensive mathematical analysis of
the channel and its corresponding hard- and soft-decision maximum likelihood
(ML) decoders. In particular, we establish explicit error exponents for ML
decoding in the LRC when using random codes under both hard- and soft-decision
decoding. This analysis allows for a direct, quantitative evaluation of the
relative advantage of soft-decision decoding. The discrete geometry of the LRC
is distinct from that of the BSC, which is characterized by the Hamming weight,
offering a new perspective on code construction for soft-decision settings.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology
in 6G networks, owing to its potential for high spectral and cost efficiency.
As a promising solution for extremely large-scale arrays, reconfigurable
holographic surfaces (RHS) can be integrated with ISAC to form the holographic
ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures of RHS can achieve
significant beamforming gains, thereby improving both communication and sensing
performance. In this paper, we investigate holographic beamforming designs for
ISAC systems, which, unlike existing holographic beamforming schemes developed
for RHS-aided communications, requires explicit consideration of mutual
coupling effects within RHS. This is because, different from prior works only
considering communication performance, ISAC systems incorporate sensing
functionality, which is sensitive to sidelobe levels. Ignoring mutual coupling
in holographic beamforming can lead to notable undesired sidelobes, thus
degrading sensing performance. The consideration of mutual coupling introduces
new challenges, i.e., it induces non-linearity in beamforming problems,
rendering them inherently non-convex. To address this issue, we propose a
tractable electromagnetic-compliant holographic ISAC model that characterizes
mutual coupling in a closed form using coupled dipole approximations. We then
develop an efficient mutual coupling aware holographic beamforming algorithm to
suppress sidelobes and enhance ISAC performance. Numerical results validate
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: 从频谱分量学习表征能更有效地弥合领域差距，SCA-LLM通过频谱注意力机制显著提升了信道预测性能。

Abstract: In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless
communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly
applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from
their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm
has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the
channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,
existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To
address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning
representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more
effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a
spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in
multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral
details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.
Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction
performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$
normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based
method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in
mitigating domain mismatch.

Abstract: The deep hole problem is a fundamental problem in coding theory, and it has
many important applications in code constructions and cryptography. The deep
hole problem of Reed-Solomon codes has gained a lot of attention. As a
generalization of Reed-Solomon codes, we investigate the problem of deep holes
of a class of twisted Reed-Solomon codes in this paper.
  Firstly, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for
$\boldsymbol{a}=(a_{0},a_{1},\cdots,a_{n-k-1})\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n-k}$ to be
the syndrome of some deep hole of $TRS_{k}(\mathcal{A},l,\eta)$. Next, we
consider the problem of determining all deep holes of the twisted Reed-Solomon
codes $TRS_{k}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*},k-1,\eta)$. Specifically, we prove that there
are no other deep holes of $TRS_{k}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{*},k-1,\eta)$ for
$\frac{3q+2\sqrt{q}-8}{4}\leq k\leq q-5$ when q is even, and
$\frac{3q+3\sqrt{q}-5}{4}\leq k\leq q-5$ when q is odd. We also completely
determine their deep holes for $q-4\leq k\leq q-2$ when $q$ is even.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估网络公平性面临挑战，因为它不是静态属性而是高度敏感于SLA参数的动态性质。需要一个理论坚实的框架来进行预测性的敏感性分析。

Method: 构建基于QoE-Imbalance指标的分析框架，该指标的形式由公平性基本公理唯一确定。推导闭式协方差规则作为本地指南，构建相图来映射全局公平性地形，分析曲率得出可行动的设计规则。

Result: 框架揭示了关键拓扑特征，如稳定带和高风险区域，提出了最优的"阈值优先"调整策略，为设计更稳健和弹性的网络提供了工具。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统敏感性地形的映射、解释和导航提供了完整工具，将公平性评估转化为主动的工程学科，最终能够设计出更稳健和弹性的网络系统。

Abstract: Evaluating network-wide fairness is challenging because it is not a static
property but one highly sensitive to Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters.
This paper introduces a complete analytical framework to transform fairness
evaluation from a single-point measurement into a proactive engineering
discipline centered on a predictable sensitivity landscape. Our framework is
built upon a QoE-Imbalance metric whose form is not an ad-hoc choice, but is
uniquely determined by a set of fundamental axioms of fairness, ensuring its
theoretical soundness. To navigate the fairness landscape across the full
spectrum of service demands, we first derive a closed-form covariance rule.
This rule provides an interpretable, local compass, expressing the fairness
gradient as the covariance between a path's information-theoretic importance
and its parameter sensitivity. We then construct phase diagrams to map the
global landscape, revealing critical topological features such as robust
"stable belts" and high-risk "dangerous wedges". Finally, an analysis of the
landscape's curvature yields actionable, topology-aware design rules, including
an optimal "Threshold-First" tuning strategy. Ultimately, our framework
provides the tools to map, interpret, and navigate the landscape of system
sensitivity, enabling the design of more robust and resilient networks.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出基于EM-AMP框架的FAS信道状态信息获取算法，利用地理位置先验知识提高估计精度、加速收敛并降低复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体天线系统需要灵活低复杂度的CSI获取方案来支持大规模连接，现有贪婪算法依赖信号假设，无模型方法复杂度高

Method: 基于期望最大化-近似消息传递(EM-AMP)框架，利用FAS的地理位置先验知识开发变体算法，实现高效矩阵计算和自适应学习

Result: 仿真验证了所提算法的有效性，在估计精度、收敛速度和复杂度方面均有改善

Conclusion: 该EM-AMP变体算法为FAS大规模部署提供了高效的信道状态信息获取解决方案

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) employs reconfigurable antennas for high
spatial gains in compact spaces, enhancing physical layer flexibility. Channel
state information (CSI) acquisition is vital for port selection and FAS
optimization. Greedy algorithms rely on signal assumptions, and model-free
methods face high complexity. A flexible, low-complexity solution is needed for
massive connectivity in FAS. Based on expectation maximization-approximate
message passing (EM-AMP) framework, efficient matrix computations and adaptive
learning without prior model knowledge naturally suit CSI acquisition for FAS.
We propose a EM-AMP variant exploiting FAS geographical priors, improving
estimation precision, accelerating convergence, and reducing complexity in
large-scale deployment. Simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithm.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个严格的框架来分析流体天线系统(FAS)在空间相关信道下的误码率性能，揭示了系统性能由信道有效秩而非天线端口数决定，并证明了天线孔径宽度是决定有效秩的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流体天线系统作为一种新兴范式，能够通过天线形状和位置的可重构性来拓展无线通信系统设计。然而，现有研究缺乏在现实空间相关信道下对FAS误码率分析的严格框架。

Method: 提出了双管齐下的方法：1) 开发基于几何的算法从信道特征值谱中提取性能阈值；2) 理论证明有效秩收敛于由天线归一化孔径宽度决定的基本极限，并建立算法阈值与理论极限的等价性。

Result: 推导出了紧密的闭式渐近符号错误率表达式，建立了系统SER与信道空间相关结构的基本缩放定律。有效秩模型比现有方法具有更高精度，完整表征了分集和编码增益。

Conclusion: FAS性能改进的根本驱动力是扩大天线的可探索孔径以增加有效信道秩，而在固定孔径内增加端口密度只能带来递减的收益。这一发现为FAS系统设计提供了明确的指导原则。

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) concept is an emerging paradigm that promotes
the utilization of the feature of shape and position reconfigurability in
antennas to broaden the design of wireless communication systems. This also
means that spatial diversity can be exploited in an unconventional way.
However, a rigorous framework for error probability analysis of FAS under
realistic spatially correlated channels has been lacking. In this paper, we
fill this gap by deriving a tight, closed-form asymptotic expression for the
symbol error rate (SER) that establishes the fundamental scaling law linking
the system's SER to the channel's spatial correlation structure. A key insight
of our analysis is that the achievable diversity gain is governed not by the
number of antenna ports, but by the channel's effective rank. To find this
critical parameter, we propose a novel dual-pronged approach. First of all, we
develop a geometry-based algorithm that extracts distinct performance
thresholds from the channel's eigenvalue spectrum. Second, we theoretically
prove that the effective rank converges to a fundamental limit dictated solely
by the antenna's normalized aperture width. We further establish the
equivalence between the threshold identified by the geometric algorithm and the
derived theoretical limit, providing rigorous validation for the proposed
method. Our effective rank model achieves higher accuracy than existing
approaches in the literature. Building on this framework, we offer a complete
characterization of diversity and coding gains. The analysis leads to a
definitive design insight: FAS performance improvements are fundamentally
driven by enlarging the antenna's explorable aperture, which increases the
effective channel rank, whereas increasing port density within a fixed aperture
yields diminishing returns.
