This paper introduces an operator-based formulation of information theory for imaging. The approach models the imaging chain as a composition of bounded operators acting on functions, and characterises information redistribution using the spectral properties of these operators. Three measures are developed. Operator entropy quantifies how an operator distributes energy across its singular spectrum. Operator information capacity describes the number of modes that remain recoverable above a noise-dependent threshold. An irreversibility index measures the information lost through suppression or elimination of modes and captures the accumulation of information loss under operator composition. The framework applies to linear, nonlinear, and stochastic operators and does not depend on the specific imaging modality. Analytical examples show how attenuation, blur, and sampling affect entropy, capacity, and irreversibility in different ways. The results provide a general structure for analysing the physical limits of imaging and form the basis for subsequent work on information geometry, spatiotemporal budgets, nonlinear channels, and reconstruction algorithms."}

Instead of transmitting pixel level video chunks, PromptPream sends compact semantic prompts that are decoded into high quality frames using generative models such as Stable Diffusion. We propose three core techniques to enable this paradigm: (1) a gradient based prompt inversion method that compresses frames into small sets of compact token embeddings; (2) a computation aware scheduling strategy that jointly optimizes network and compute resource usage; and (3) a scalable searching algorithm that addresses the enlarged scheduling space introduced by scheduler. Evaluations show that PromptStream reduces both stalls and bandwidth waste by over 31%, and improves Quality of Experience (QoE) by 45%, compared to traditional strategies."}

However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon: even when the actual encoded bitrate does not fully utilize the available bandwidth, stalling events remain frequent. This insufficient bandwidth utilization arises from the intrinsic temporal variations of real-time video encoding, which cause conventional packet-level congestion control algorithms to misestimate available bandwidth. When a high-bitrate frame is suddenly produced, sending at the wrong rate can either trigger packet loss or increase queueing delay, resulting in playback stalls.\n  To address these issues, we present Camel, a novel frame-level congestion control algorithm (CCA) tailored for LLS. Our insight is to use frame-level network feedback to capture the true network capacity, immune to the irregular sending pattern caused by encoding. Camel comprises three key modules: the Bandwidth and Delay Estimator and the Congestion Detector, which jointly determine the average sending rate, and the Bursting Length Controller, which governs the emission pattern to prevent packet loss.\n  We evaluate Camel on both large-scale real-world deployments and controlled simulations. In the real-world platform with 250M users and 2B sessions across 150+ countries, Camel achieves up to a 70.8% increase in 1080P resolution ratio, a 14.4% increase in media bitrate, and up to a 14.1% reduction in stalling ratio. In simulations under undershooting, shallow buffers, and network jitter, Camel outperforms existing congestion control algorithms, with up to 19.8% higher bitrate, 93.0% lower stalling ratio, and 23.9% improvement in bandwidth estimation accuracy."}

Machine learning (ML)-based localization using channel state information (CSI) is one of the most popular methods for achieving high-accuracy localization with low cost. However, to be accurate and robust, ML-based algorithms need to be trained and tested with large amounts of data, covering not only many user equipment (UE)/target locations, but also many different access points (APs) locations to which the UEs connect, in a variety of different environment types. This paper presents a massive-sized CSI dataset, WiLoc (Wi-Fi Localization), and makes it publicly available. WiLoc is obtained by a series of precision measurement campaigns that span three months, and it is massive in all the above-mentioned three dimensions: > 12 million UE locations, > 3,000 APs, covering 16 buildings for indoor localization, and > 30 streets for outdoor use. The paper describes the dataset structure, measurement environments, measurement protocols, and the dataset validations.

We reinterpret the Fermat equation as an $n$-th moment constraint, constructing a statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}_n$ of generalized normal distributions via the Maximum Entropy Principle. By Chentsov's Theorem, the natural metric is the Fisher information metric ($L^2$); however, the global structure is governed by the $L^n$ moment constraint. This reveals a discrepancy between the local quadratic metric and the global $L^n$ structure. We axiomatically define an \"Information-Geometric Fermat Solution,\" postulating that the lattice structure must maintain \"dual lattice consistency\" under the Legendre transform. We prove the non-existence of such structures for $n \\ge 3$. Through the Poisson Summation Formula and Hausdorff-Young Inequality, we demonstrate that the Fourier transform induces an alteration of the function family ($L^n \\to L^q$, where $1/n + 1/q = 1$), rendering dual lattice consistency analytically impossible. This identifies a geometric obstruction where integer and energy structures are incompatible within a dually flat space.

To implement this, we first fine-tune a pre-trained large wireless model (LWM) to translate raw channel data into low-dimensional, context-aware channel state information (CSI) embeddings. Next, these embeddings are combined with user location information and blockage status to select the optimal communication path. The resulting features are then fed into an HDRL model, assumed to be implemented at a centralized controller, which jointly optimizes the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and the RIS phase-shift configurations to maximize SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FM-HDRL framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, spectral efficiency, and scalability. According to the simulation results, our proposed method improves 7.82% SE compared to the FM-aided deep reinforcement learning (FM-DRL) approach and a substantial enhancement of about 48.66% relative to the beam sweeping approach."}

It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets."}

In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas.

However, the quality of ISAR images degrades due to road clutter and when translational and higher order rotational motions of the targets are not suitably compensated. One method to enhance the signal-to-clutter-and-noise ratio (SCNR) of the systems is to leverage the advantages of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) framework available in commercial automotive radars to generate MIMO-ISAR images. While substantial research has been devoted to motion compensation of single-channel ISAR images, the effectiveness of these methods for MIMO-ISAR has not been studied extensively. This paper analyzes the performance of three popular motion compensation techniques - entropy minimization, cross-correlation, and phase gradient autofocus - on MIMO-ISAR. The algorithms are evaluated on the measurement data collected using Texas Instruments millimeter-wave MIMO radar. The results indicate that the cross-correlation MOCOMP performs better than the other two MOCOMP algorithms in the MIMO configuration, with an overall improvement of 36%."}

This paper introduces an operator-based formulation of information theory for imaging. The approach models the imaging chain as a composition of bounded operators acting on functions, and characterises information redistribution using the spectral properties of these operators. Three measures are developed. Operator entropy quantifies how an operator distributes energy across its singular spectrum. Operator information capacity describes the number of modes that remain recoverable above a noise-dependent threshold. An irreversibility index measures the information lost through suppression or elimination of modes and captures the accumulation of information loss under operator composition. The framework applies to linear, nonlinear, and stochastic operators and does not depend on the specific imaging modality. Analytical examples show how attenuation, blur, and sampling affect entropy, capacity, and irreversibility in different ways. The results provide a general structure for analysing the physical limits of imaging and form the basis for subsequent work on information geometry, spatiotemporal budgets, nonlinear channels, and reconstruction algorithms."}

Nevertheless, the realization of JCAS is hindered by inherent trade-offs between communication and sensing objectives, limited controllability of wireless propagation, and stringent hardware and design constraints. Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) have recently emerged as a promising technology to address these challenges by enabling full-space programmable manipulation of electromagnetic waves.

The proposed approach uses spatial coordinate labels to supervise a position extraction branch and integrates the resulting representations with beam-domain features through a feature fusion module. A dual-branch RegNet architecture is adopted to jointly learn location related and communication features for beam prediction. Two fusion strategies, namely adaptive fusion and adversarial fusion, are introduced to enable efficient feature integration. The proposed framework is evaluated on datasets generated by the DeepMIMO simulator across four urban scenarios at 3.5 GHz following 3GPP specifications, where both reference signal received power and user equipment location information are available.

Author version", "summary": "Rolling element bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their condition significantly influences system performance, reliability, and operational lifespan. Timely and accurate fault detection is essential to prevent unexpected failures and reduce maintenance costs. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual feature extraction and shallow classifiers, which may be inadequate for capturing the complex patterns embedded in raw vibration signals. In this study, a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for automated bearing fault diagnosis using raw time-domain vibration data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The model is trained and evaluated on two established benchmark datasets: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. The CWRU data were segmented based on four distinct motor load conditions (0 HP to 3 HP), with each load scenario trained and tested independently to ensure strict separation and prevent data leakage. The CNN achieved high average test accuracies of 99.14%, 98.85%, 97.42%, and 95.14% for 0 HP, 1 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP, respectively. On the PU dataset, known for its naturally induced faults and greater operational variability the model achieved a robust average testing accuracy of 95.63%. These results affirm the model ability to generalize across datasets and varying operating conditions. Further improvements were observed through hyperparameter tuning, particularly window length and training epochs, underscoring the importance of tailored configurations for specific datasets and load conditions. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of 1D CNNs for real-time, data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, offering a reliable foundation for condition monitoring in industrial applications."}

The dual-algorithm design integrates (i) Adaptive Hybrid Node Role Switching between secure transmission and cooperative jamming (ii) Belief-Driven Sensing and Beamforming for confidence based resource allocation. The proposed unified framework significantly improves robustness against attacks while preserving linear computational complexity. Simulation results across carrier frequencies ranging from 28 to 410 GHz demonstrate that the method achieves up to a 35% increase in secrecy rates and a success rate exceeding 98%, outperforming conventional communication systems with minimal runtime overhead.

Here, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, which simultaneously reduces his detection error probabilities and degrades the communication performance between Alice and Bob, without relying on either channel state information (CSI) or additional jamming power. However, the introduction of the DRIS renders it intractable for Willie to construct a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, since the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistic is analytically intractable under the Alice-Bob transmission hypothesis. Moreover, given the adversarial relationship between Willie and Alice/Bob, it is unrealistic to assume that Willie has access to a labeled training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised masked autoregressive flow (MAF)-based NP detection framework that exploits prior knowledge inherent in covert communications. We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS. Simulations validate the theory and show that the proposed unsupervised MAF-based NP detector achieves performance comparable to its supervised counterpart."}

To overcome these obstacles, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, is a promising candidate. We propose a novel unified joint multi-objective framework where UAVs and HAPS-RIS are fully integrated to extend coverage and enhance network performance. This joint multi-objective design maximizes the number of users served by the HAPS-RIS, minimizes the number of UAVs deployed and minimizes the total average UAV path loss subject to quality-of-service (QoS) and resource constraints. We propose a novel low-complexity solution strategy by proving the equivalence between minimizing the total average UAV path loss upper bound and k-means clustering, deriving a practical closed-form RIS phase-shift design, and introducing a mapping technique that collapses the combinatorial assignments into a zone radius and a bandwidth-portioning factor. Then, we propose a dynamic Pareto optimization technique to solve the transformed optimization problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adapts seamlessly across operating regimes. A HAPS-RIS-only setup achieves full coverage at low data rates, but UAV assistance becomes indispensable as rate demands increase. By tuning a single bandwidth portioning factor, the model recovers UAV-only, HAPS-RIS-only and equal bandwidth portioning baselines within one formulation and consistently surpasses them across diverse rate requirements. The simulations also quantify a tangible trade-off between RIS scale and UAV deployment, enabling designers to trade increased RIS elements for fewer UAVs as service demands evolve."}

In our experiment, commodity WiFi transceivers are used, representing a practical MIMO system. In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$. These results provide the first experimental evidence of RIS-driven rank manipulation with off-the-shelf WiFi hardware, offering practical insights into RIS deployment for spatial multiplexing gains."}
