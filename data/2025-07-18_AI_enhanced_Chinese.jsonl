By dynamically\nplacing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)\nconnections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although\nrecent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted\ndesigns, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an\nimpractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust\nresource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with\nuncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit\npower while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we\naddress the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position\nand obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method\ncombined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the\nmulti-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using\na particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting\nnon-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem.

Copyright maybe transferred without notice", "summary": "Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a\ndelay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is\ncarried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is\npredictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,\nalbeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication\nscheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot\ntransmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be\nused as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data\ncan enable further detection enabling the \"differential\" aspect of the\ncommunication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD\nchannel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data\nsymbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next\ninstant and propagate this forward.

However, in many papers neural\nnetworks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel\nor similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new\ndata which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training\nknowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be\ntime-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited\ncomputing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing\nresources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This\nmotivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform\nrobustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information\nbeing known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to\ngenerate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that\nafter training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error\n(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network\nsolutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for\nreal-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further\npropose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different\nchannel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks\nwith different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved\nappears to be independent of neural network architecture.

Most existing works in this area adopt sophisticated optimization\nand learning tools to identify the optimal antenna locations in a numerical\nmanner, where insightful understandings of the pinching antenna placement are\nstill missing. Motivated by this research gap, this paper aims to carry out\nanalytical optimization for pinching antenna placement, where closed-form\nsolutions for the optimal antenna locations are obtained to reveal the impact\nof antenna placement on the system performance. In particular, for the\nuser-fairness-oriented orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based transmission,\nanalytical results are obtained to reveal that the pinching antenna needs to be\nactivated at the place that would be beneficial to all served users; however,\nthe users' distances to the waveguide have no impact on the location selection.\nFor the greedy-allocation-based OMA transmission, an asymptotic study based on\na high signal-to-noise ratio approximation is carried out to show that the\noptimal antenna location is in close proximity to the user who is nearest to\nthe waveguide. For non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission,\neven with a user-fairness-oriented objective, the obtained analytical results\nshow that the optimal antenna location is not the position that can benefit all\nusers, but rather is near the user positioned closest to the waveguide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u5740\uff08OMA\uff09\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u5740\uff08NOMA\uff09\u4f20\u8f93\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u516c\u5e73\u5bfc\u5411\u7684OMA\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e94\u6709\u76ca\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u5206\u914d\u7684OMA\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9760\u8fd1\u6700\u8fd1\u7528\u6237\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8eNOMA\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9760\u8fd1\u6700\u8fd1\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Despite advances in\nmulti-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures\nthat effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different\nphysiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in\nmany biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional\nmethods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified\ndeep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across\ndifferent signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an\nattention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:\ntime-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to\ngenerate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase\nsignal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in\nthe best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps\nincluded wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class\nimbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced\ndata augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were\napplied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the\nproposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH\nArrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,\nand 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types\nand clinical contexts.

Its attractiveness stems from\nleveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting\ndiodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision\npositioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread\nadoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the\nincreased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,\nwhich consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant\nflux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept\nof unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals\nof Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as\nconventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure\nalternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation\nhardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the\nfundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus\nconventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to\nreceiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar\ncells, etc.) and imaging-based methods. Additionally, we propose a\ncomprehensive taxonomy categorizing techniques into demultiplexed and\nundemultiplexed approaches.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local\nSynthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but\nsuffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D\nimage generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D\ninpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule\nand the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for\nhigh-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial\ntraining. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet\ndiffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting\nmodel, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a\nPSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these\nscores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81\ns per image.

We present a hybrid\nframework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive\nsensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor\ndata. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates\ncoincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and\nCD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module\nreconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise\nrecovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and\nhydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine\nalgorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and\nimproving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class\nactivation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures\ntransparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow\ncytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating\nmodalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse\nsensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical\nsingle-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of\nresolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in\ntranslational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction\nstudies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FCN\uff09\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\uff08CS\uff09\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56e0\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528FCN\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u53e0\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CS\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u591a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0821%\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc797%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u975e\u5149\u5b66\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u901a\u7528\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
