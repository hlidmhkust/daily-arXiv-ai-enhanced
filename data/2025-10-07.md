*Juampablo E. Heras Rivera,Caitlin M. Neher,Mehmet Kurt*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 开发并评估了用于脑磁共振弹性成像非线性反演的算子学习框架oNLI，实现了实时弹性图反演，精度与非线性反演相当，速度提升30,000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够实时反演脑磁共振弹性成像数据的框架，同时保持与非线性反演相当的精细空间精度。

Method: 使用61名受试者的3D MRE数据，训练预测性深度算子学习框架oNLI，采用10折交叉验证，输入为测量位移场的复旋度，输出为NLI导出的参考弹性图，并加入结构先验机制以提高空间精度。

Result: oNLI在全脑绝对百分比误差为8.4±0.5(μ')和10.0±0.7(μ'')，显著优于CNN的15.8±0.8(μ')和26.1±1.1(μ'')。在存储模量和损耗模量的Pearson相关系数方面，oNLI在全脑和所有子区域均优于卷积架构(p<0.05)。

Conclusion: oNLI框架实现了实时MRE反演(30,000倍加速)，优于基于CNN的方法，并保持了NLI在脑部可实现的精细空间精度。

Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To develop and evaluate an operator learning framework
for nonlinear inversion (NLI) of brain magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)
data, which enables real-time inversion of elastograms with comparable spatial
accuracy to NLI.
  $\textbf{Materials and Methods:}$ In this retrospective study, 3D MRE data
from 61 individuals (mean age, 37.4 years; 34 female) were used for development
of the framework. A predictive deep operator learning framework (oNLI) was
trained using 10-fold cross-validation, with the complex curl of the measured
displacement field as inputs and NLI-derived reference elastograms as outputs.
A structural prior mechanism, analogous to Soft Prior Regularization in the MRE
literature, was incorporated to improve spatial accuracy. Subject-level
evaluation metrics included Pearson's correlation coefficient, absolute
relative error, and structural similarity index measure between predicted and
reference elastograms across brain regions of different sizes to understand
accuracy. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests comparing the proposed
oNLI variants to the convolutional neural network baselines.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ Whole brain absolute percent error was 8.4 $\pm$ 0.5
($\mu'$) and 10.0 $\pm$ 0.7 ($\mu''$) for oNLI and 15.8 $\pm$ 0.8 ($\mu'$) and
26.1 $\pm$ 1.1 ($\mu''$) for CNNs. Additionally, oNLI outperformed
convolutional architectures as per Pearson's correlation coefficient, $r$, in
the whole brain and across all subregions for both the storage modulus and loss
modulus (p < 0.05).
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ The oNLI framework enables real-time MRE inversion
(30,000x speedup), outperforming CNN-based approaches and maintaining the
fine-grained spatial accuracy achievable with NLI in the brain.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究通过数据增强和模型集成方法，在非洲脑肿瘤数据集上提高了脑肿瘤分割的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型主要在高质量同质数据集上训练，在资源匮乏地区部署时表现不佳，需要提高在多样化数据集上的泛化能力。

Method: 使用分割感知离线数据增强扩展数据样本，构建MedNeXt、SegMamba和Residual-Encoder U-Net三种架构的集成模型。

Result: MedNeXt模型在1000轮训练后获得最高平均病灶Dice分数0.86和归一化表面距离0.81，集成模型在500轮训练后在肿瘤亚区域上表现最均衡。

Conclusion: 先进的数据增强和模型集成方法能够提高在多样化和代表性不足数据集上的分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Brain tumors, particularly gliomas, pose significant chall-enges due to their
complex growth patterns, infiltrative nature, and the variability in brain
structure across individuals, which makes accurate diagnosis and monitoring
difficult. Deep learning models have been developed to accurately delineate
these tumors. However, most of these models were trained on relatively
homogenous high-resource datasets, limiting their robustness when deployed in
underserved regions. In this study, we performed segmentation-aware offline
data augmentation on the BraTS-Africa dataset to increase the data sample size
and diversity to enhance generalization. We further constructed an ensemble of
three distinct architectures, MedNeXt, SegMamba, and Residual-Encoder U-Net, to
leverage their complementary strengths. Our best-performing model, MedNeXt, was
trained on 1000 epochs and achieved the highest average lesion-wise dice and
normalized surface distance scores of 0.86 and 0.81 respectively. However, the
ensemble model trained for 500 epochs produced the most balanced segmentation
performance across the tumour subregions. This work demonstrates that a
combination of advanced augmentation and model ensembling can improve
segmentation accuracy and robustness on diverse and underrepresented datasets.

### [3] [ReTiDe: Real-Time Denoising for Energy-Efficient Motion Picture Processing with FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03812)
*Changhong Li,Clément Bled,Rosa Fernandez,Shreejith Shanker*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ReTiDe是一个基于FPGA硬件加速的实时去噪系统，通过INT8量化和AMD DPU编译，在保持图像质量的同时实现高效能去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的深度学习去噪器计算密集，在GPU上部署成本高、功耗大，需要更高效的硬件加速解决方案。

Method: 采用紧凑卷积模型，进行训练后INT8量化和量化感知微调，编译到AMD DPU FPGA上，通过客户端-服务器架构实现计算卸载。

Result: 在代表性基准测试中，ReTiDe达到37.71×GOPS吞吐量和5.29×能效提升，PSNR/SSIM质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 专用加速器可以为编码管道和后制作提供实用、可扩展的去噪方案，在不牺牲质量或工作流兼容性的情况下降低每帧能耗。

Abstract: Denoising is a core operation in modern video pipelines. In codecs, in-loop
filters suppress sensor noise and quantisation artefacts to improve
rate-distortion performance; in cinema post-production, denoisers are used for
restoration, grain management, and plate clean-up. However, state-of-the-art
deep denoisers are computationally intensive and, at scale, are typically
deployed on GPUs, incurring high power and cost for real-time, high-resolution
streams. This paper presents Real-Time Denoise (ReTiDe), a hardware-accelerated
denoising system that serves inference on data-centre Field Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGAs). A compact convolutional model is quantised (post-training
quantisation plus quantisation-aware fine-tuning) to INT8 and compiled for AMD
Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU)-based FPGAs. A client-server integration
offloads computation from the host CPU/GPU to a networked FPGA service, while
remaining callable from existing workflows, e.g., NUKE, without disrupting
artist tooling. On representative benchmarks, ReTiDe delivers 37.71$\times$
Giga Operations Per Second (GOPS) throughput and 5.29$\times$ higher energy
efficiency than prior FPGA denoising accelerators, with negligible degradation
in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)/Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). These
results indicate that specialised accelerators can provide practical, scalable
denoising for both encoding pipelines and post-production, reducing energy per
frame without sacrificing quality or workflow compatibility. Code is available

### [4] [Towards Robust and Generalizable Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03833)
*Shuoyan Wei,Feng Li,Shengeng Tang,Runmin Cong,Yao Zhao,Meng Wang,Huihui Bai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EvEnhancer是一个结合事件流特性的连续时空视频超分辨率方法，通过事件自适应合成和局部隐式视频变换器实现任意时空尺度的视频重建，并开发了EvEnhancerPlus版本通过可控切换机制降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时空视频超分辨率方法在分布外尺度上泛化能力差，无法产生令人满意的结果。

Method: 1. 事件自适应合成利用帧与事件间的时空相关性捕获长期运动轨迹；2. 局部隐式视频变换器结合局部隐式视频神经函数与跨尺度时空注意力；3. EvEnhancerPlus添加可控切换机制，基于局部事件统计动态确定重建难度；4. 交叉导数训练策略通过分阶段交叉优化稳定多路径框架收敛。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，在分布外尺度上保持优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvEnhancer方法通过结合事件流特性和创新的多路径架构，实现了鲁棒且可泛化的连续时空视频超分辨率，在性能和计算效率方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) has garnered
increasing interest for its capability to reconstruct high-resolution and
high-frame-rate videos at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales. However,
prevailing methods often generalize poorly, producing unsatisfactory results
when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) scales. To overcome this limitation,
we present EvEnhancer, a novel approach that marries the unique properties of
high temporal resolution and high dynamic range encapsulated in event streams
to achieve robust and generalizable C-STVSR. Our approach incorporates
event-adapted synthesis that capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations
between frames and events to capture long-term motion trajectories, enabling
adaptive interpolation and fusion across space and time. This is then coupled
with a local implicit video transformer that integrates local implicit video
neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous
video representations and generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions
and frame rates. We further develop EvEnhancerPlus, which builds a controllable
switching mechanism that dynamically determines the reconstruction difficulty
for each spatiotemporal pixel based on local event statistics. This allows the
model to adaptively route reconstruction along the most suitable pathways at a
fine-grained pixel level, substantially reducing computational overhead while
maintaining excellent performance. Furthermore, we devise a cross-derivative
training strategy that stabilizes the convergence of such a multi-pathway
framework through staged cross-optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, while maintaining superior generalizability at OOD scales.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 开发了一种名为TTAS的半监督深度学习框架，用于从CT扫描中准确分割和量化胸腔积液，相比现有模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸腔积液是常见临床问题，但从CT扫描中准确测量其体积具有挑战性，需要改进分割和量化方法以提升临床管理。

Method: 使用CT肺动脉造影数据，开发了教师-助教-学生(TTAS)半监督深度学习框架，在100例手动标注数据上训练，并在未分割检查中实现高效训练。

Result: TTAS模型在分割性能上显著优于现有模型，平均Dice得分为0.82 vs 0.73，平均绝对体积差异为6.49mL vs 23.16mL，差异均具有统计学意义。

Conclusion: TTAS框架提供了优越的胸腔积液分割能力，有助于从CT扫描中准确确定积液体积。

Abstract: Background: Pleural Effusions (PE) is a common finding in many different
clinical conditions, but accurately measuring their volume from CT scans is
challenging. Purpose: To improve PE segmentation and quantification for
enhanced clinical management, we have developed and trained a semi-supervised
deep learning framework on contrast-enhanced CT volumes. Materials and Methods:
This retrospective study collected CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) data from
internal and external datasets. A subset of 100 cases was manually annotated
for model training, while the remaining cases were used for testing and
validation. A novel semi-supervised deep learning framework, Teacher-Teaching
Assistant-Student (TTAS), was developed and used to enable efficient training
in non-segmented examinations. Segmentation performance was compared to that of
state-of-the-art models. Results: 100 patients (mean age, 72 years, 28
[standard deviation]; 55 men) were included in the study. The TTAS model
demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art
models, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79 - 0.84) versus 0.73
for nnU-Net (p < 0.0001, Student's T test). Additionally, TTAS exhibited a
four-fold lower mean Absolute Volume Difference (AbVD) of 6.49 mL (95% CI, 4.80
- 8.20) compared to nnU-Net's AbVD of 23.16 mL (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The
developed TTAS framework offered superior PE segmentation, aiding accurate
volume determination from CT scans.

### [6] [Sliding Window Attention for Learned Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03926)
*Alexander Kopte,André Kaup*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了3D滑动窗口注意力机制，替代传统的分块注意力，解决了视频压缩中变换器模型的复杂性问题，显著提升了率失真性能并降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频压缩变换器采用分块注意力机制存在不规则感受野和计算冗余的问题，特别是在时间自回归模型中需要重叠窗口，增加了计算负担。

Method: 引入3D滑动窗口注意力，这是一种无分块的局部注意力形式，采用仅解码器架构统一处理空间和时间上下文，提供均匀的感受野。

Result: 相比VCT基线，Bjørntegaard Delta-rate节省高达18.6%，解码器复杂度降低2.8倍，熵模型效率提升近3.5倍。

Conclusion: 3D滑动窗口注意力机制能有效提升视频压缩性能并降低复杂度，但过长的上下文范围可能反而降低性能。

Abstract: To manage the complexity of transformers in video compression, local
attention mechanisms are a practical necessity. The common approach of
partitioning frames into patches, however, creates architectural flaws like
irregular receptive fields. When adapted for temporal autoregressive models,
this paradigm, exemplified by the Video Compression Transformer (VCT), also
necessitates computationally redundant overlapping windows. This work
introduces 3D Sliding Window Attention (SWA), a patchless form of local
attention. By enabling a decoder-only architecture that unifies spatial and
temporal context processing, and by providing a uniform receptive field, our
method significantly improves rate-distortion performance, achieving
Bj{\o}rntegaard Delta-rate savings of up to 18.6 % against the VCT baseline.
Simultaneously, by eliminating the need for overlapping windows, our method
reduces overall decoder complexity by a factor of 2.8, while its entropy model
is nearly 3.5 times more efficient. We further analyze our model's behavior and
show that while it benefits from long-range temporal context, excessive context
can degrade performance.

### [7] [The method of the approximate inverse for limited-angle CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04369)
*Bernadette Hahn,Gael Rigaud,Richard Schmähl*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模型驱动方法CLARK，用于解决有限角度CT重建中的伪影问题，结合了谱滤波、近似逆方法和边缘保持去噪技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限角度CT在工业和医疗中具有重要应用价值，但传统方法如FBP和TV会产生伪影，而深度学习需要大量数据集。需要开发不依赖大数据的新方法。

Method: 基于近似逆方法，预计算重建核作为辅助问题的解，结合谱滤波和边缘保持去噪形成CLARK正则化策略。

Result: LARK方法能够完全重建物体而不产生条纹伪影，但对半离散数据存在严重病态问题。CLARK方法有效稳定了重建过程。

Conclusion: CLARK方法为有限角度CT重建提供了有效的模型驱动解决方案，可作为未来学习策略的新起点。

Abstract: Limited-angle computerized tomography stands for one of the most difficult
challenges in imaging. Although it opens the way to faster data acquisition in
industry and less dangerous scans in medicine, standard approaches, such as the
filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm or the widely used total-variation
functional, often produce various artefacts that hinder the diagnosis. With the
rise of deep learning, many modern techniques have proven themselves successful
in removing such artefacts but at the cost of large datasets. In this paper, we
propose a new model-driven approach based on the method of the approximate
inverse, which could serve as new starting point for learning strategies in the
future. In contrast to FBP-type approaches, our reconstruction step consists in
evaluating linear functionals on the measured data using reconstruction kernels
that are precomputed as solution of an auxiliary problem. With this problem
being uniquely solvable, the derived limited-angle reconstruction kernel (LARK)
is able to fully reconstruct the object without the well-known streak
artefacts, even for large limited angles. However, it inherits severe
ill-conditioning which leads to a different kind of artefacts arising from the
singular functions of the limited-angle Radon transform. The problem becomes
particularly challenging when working on semi-discrete (real or analytical)
measurements. We develop a general regularization strategy, named constrained
limited-angle reconstruction kernel (CLARK), by combining spectral filter, the
method of the approximate inverse and custom edge-preserving denoising in order
to stabilize the whole process. We further derive and interpret error estimates
for the application on real, i.e. semi-discrete, data and we validate our
approach on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: 该模型有效减少了阶梯效应，同时保持了与经典模型相似的边缘保护能力，在各种噪声条件下都有稳定表现。

Abstract: We propose a new image denoising model based on a variable-growth total
variation regularization of double-phase type with adaptive weight. It is
designed to reduce staircasing with respect to the classical
Rudin--Osher--Fatemi model, while preserving the edges of the image in a
similar fashion. We implement the model and test its performance on synthetic
and natural images in 1D and 2D over a range of noise levels.

Conclusion: 在空地一体化感知通信网络中，考虑聚合感知干扰能更准确地评估高密度基站场景下的感知性能。

Abstract: To support the development of low altitude economy, the air-ground integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) networks need to be constructed to provide
reliable and robust communication and sensing services. In this paper, the
sensing capabilities in the cooperative air-ground ISAC networks are evaluated
in terms of area radar detection coverage probability under a constant false
alarm rate, where the distribution of aggregated sensing interferences is
analyzed as a key intermediate result. Compared with the analysis based on the
strongest interferer approximation, taking the aggregated sensing interference
into consideration is better suited for pico-cell scenarios with high base
station density. Simulations are conducted to validate the analysis.

### [10] [Privacy Enhancement in Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Adaptive Receive Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03860)
*Faeze Moradi Kalarde,Ben Liang,Min Dong,Yahia A. Eldemerdash Ahmed,Ho Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在联邦学习中自适应设计接收缩放因子的方法，以平衡训练收敛性和隐私保护的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习的空中聚合中，接收缩放因子会影响信号质量和隐私保护。较大的缩放因子能降低噪声功率提升训练性能，但会减少不确定性从而损害设备隐私。

Method: 开发了名为AdaScale的在线算法，通过求解一系列每轮优化问题来动态调整接收缩放因子，同时确保全局损失函数的收敛性。

Result: 理论分析表明AdaScale实现了时间平均Rényi差分隐私泄露的递减动态遗憾，并确保联邦学习训练收敛到驻点。数值实验显示相比现有方法能有效降低RDP和DP泄露而不影响学习性能。

Conclusion: 提出的AdaScale方法能够在动态信道条件下有效平衡联邦学习的训练收敛性和隐私保护需求。

Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL) with over-the-air aggregation, the quality of the
signal received at the server critically depends on the receive scaling
factors. While a larger scaling factor can reduce the effective noise power and
improve training performance, it also compromises the privacy of devices by
reducing uncertainty. In this work, we aim to adaptively design the receive
scaling factors across training rounds to balance the trade-off between
training convergence and privacy in an FL system under dynamic channel
conditions. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the
overall R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) leakage over the entire training
process, subject to a long-term constraint that ensures convergence of the
global loss function. Our problem depends on unknown future information, and we
observe that standard Lyapunov optimization is not applicable. Thus, we develop
a new online algorithm, termed AdaScale, based on a sequence of novel per-round
problems that can be solved efficiently. We further derive upper bounds on the
dynamic regret and constraint violation of AdaSacle, establishing that it
achieves diminishing dynamic regret in terms of time-averaged RDP leakage while
ensuring convergence of FL training to a stationary point. Numerical
experiments on canonical classification tasks show that our approach
effectively reduces RDP and DP leakages compared with state-of-the-art
benchmarks without compromising learning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI多模态多任务语义通信方案要求发射端拥有完整模态数据并参与所有接收端任务，导致传输冗余，与信道容量和计算能力的物理限制相冲突。

Method: 扩展分布式信息瓶颈理论，引入模态选择作为关键设计变量；将模态选择松弛为概率形式，使用评分函数估计和公共随机性来优化分布式设备的协调决策。

Conclusion: PoM²-DIB框架通过模态选择和分布式信息瓶颈编码，在遵循物理约束的同时实现了高效的语义通信，为多模态多任务通信提供了灵活的质量与速率权衡方案。

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) shifts the focus from data transmission to
meaning delivery, enabling efficient and intelligent communication.
  Existing AI-based coding schemes for multi-modal multi-task SemCom often
require transmitters with full-modal data to participate in all receivers'
tasks, which leads to redundant transmissions and conflicts with the physical
limits of channel capacity and computational capability.
  In this paper, we propose PoM$^2$-DIB, a novel framework that extends the
distributed information bottleneck (DIB) theory to address this problem.
  Unlike the typical DIB, this framework introduces modality selection as an
additional key design variable, enabling a more flexible tradeoff between
communication rate and inference quality.
  This extension selects only the most relevant modalities for task
participation, adhering to the physical constraints, while following efficient
DIB-based coding.
  To optimize selection and coding end-to-end, we relax modality selection into
a probabilistic form, allowing the use of score function estimation with common
randomness to enable optimizable coordinated decisions across distributed
devices.
  Experimental results on public datasets verify that PoM$^2$-DIB achieves high
inference quality compared to full-participation baselines in various tasks
under physical limits.

### [12] [Volume-Based Lower Bounds to the Capacity of the Gaussian Channel Under Pointwise Additive Input Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04095)
*Neri Merhav,Shlomo Shamai*

TL;DR: 提出了高斯信道在点式加性输入约束下的容量下界，包括基于熵功率不等式和直接互信息操作的两类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高斯信道在点式加性约束（而非期望约束）下的容量下界问题，这类约束在实际应用中更常见。

Method: 使用类型方法扩展到连续字母表、鞍点积分方法和大偏差理论工具，精确评估满足约束的输入向量集的体积指数。

Result: 提出了两类下界：基于EPI的连续输入下界和更通用的直接互信息操作下界，后者更紧但技术更复杂。

Conclusion: 提供了统一且相对简单的容量下界框架，适用于多种实际相关约束，并通过数值示例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We present a family of relatively simple and unified lower bounds on the
capacity of the Gaussian channel under a set of pointwise additive input
constraints. Specifically, the admissible channel input vectors $\bx = (x_1,
\ldots, x_n)$ must satisfy $k$ additive cost constraints of the form
$\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_j(x_i) \le n \Gamma_j$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$, which are
enforced pointwise for every $\bx$, rather than merely in expectation. More
generally, we also consider cost functions that depend on a sliding window of
fixed length $m$, namely, $\sum_{i=m}^n \phi_j(x_i, x_{i-1}, \ldots, x_{i-m+1})
\le n \Gamma_j$, $j = 1,2,\ldots,k$, a formulation that naturally accommodates
correlation constraints as well as a broad range of other constraints of
practical relevance. We propose two classes of lower bounds, derived by two
methodologies that both rely on the exact evaluation of the volume exponent
associated with the set of input vectors satisfying the given constraints. This
evaluation exploits extensions of the method of types to continuous alphabets,
the saddle-point method of integration, and basic tools from large deviations
theory. The first class of bounds is obtained via the entropy power inequality
(EPI), and therefore applies exclusively to continuous-valued inputs. The
second class, by contrast, is more general, and it applies to discrete input
alphabets as well. It is based on a direct manipulation of mutual information,
and it yields stronger and tighter bounds, though at the cost of greater
technical complexity. Numerical examples illustrating both types of bounds are
provided, and several extensions and refinements are also discussed.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了二维实空间中相位恢复最优框架与1922年Reinhardt提出的周长最大化等直径问题之间的联系，证明了后者每个最优解都对应一个相位恢复最优框架，并完整刻画了当m≥3且含奇数因子时的所有最优框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究相位恢复的最优框架特性，探索其与经典几何问题的深层联系，为相位恢复理论提供新视角，同时推进对周长最大化等直径问题的理解。

Method: 通过将最优多边形问题重新表述为关于单位根差异性的问题，建立了相位恢复最优框架与周长最大化等直径问题之间的数学联系，并利用这种联系来刻画所有最优框架。

Result: 证明了当m≥3且含奇数因子时，可以完整刻画二维实空间中所有相位恢复最优框架；关键推论是谐波框架Em在m≥4的偶数时不最优，这推翻了Xia等人的猜想；同时确认了当m为奇数时谐波框架确实是最优的。

Conclusion: 成功建立了相位恢复最优框架与经典几何问题的深刻联系，不仅解决了最优框架的刻画问题，还推翻了先前的猜想，为相位恢复理论和离散几何提供了新的见解。

Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval,
defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its
minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the
connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the
perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in
1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the
perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame
in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning
the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons.
Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$
vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd
factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not}
optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture
proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 90(356): 2931-2960). Previous work
has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed
optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this
paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new
perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究由独立同质素数乘子驱动的整数值乘法动力学，将其宏观统计与通用编码长度联系起来，提出了乘法图灵系综(MTE)模型，并通过理论和实证分析揭示了机器适应机制与人类生成复杂性之间的定性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是连接乘法动力学与通用编码长度，探索概率图灵机系综中自然产生的乘法图灵系综，并通过变分建模原则建立整数和素数的规范吉布斯先验。

Method: 采用变分建模方法，以Elias的Omega编码长度作为能量函数，施加最大熵约束得到整数的规范吉布斯先验；在温和尾部假设下，该先验诱导对数乘子的指数尾部，进而产生加性间隙的帕累托尾部；同时证明了MTE轨迹上Omega编码长度的时间平均定律。

Result: 在Debian和PyPI包大小数据集上，缩放的Omega先验在编码长度直方图上实现了最低的KL散度；理论-数据比较表明存在定性分裂：机器适应机制（吉布斯对齐，有限一阶矩）表现出清晰的平均行为，而人类生成的复杂性似乎超出这一机制，尾部足够重以产生无界一阶矩。

Conclusion: 乘法图灵系综为理解乘法动力学与编码长度之间的关系提供了理论框架，揭示了机器适应机制与人类生成复杂性在统计特性上的根本差异，后者具有更重的尾部特征和无界一阶矩。

Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime
multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths.
We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises
naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing
machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength
as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs
prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions,
this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying
corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also
prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories.
Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior
achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken
together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split:
machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean
averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond
this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and
therefore no averaging of the same kind.

TL;DR: 提出了基于压缩牛顿方向的两类稀疏优化算法：CNHTP和CNOTP，通过低维子空间计算牛顿方向降低计算成本，在保持牛顿方法效率的同时提高了稀疏优化问题的求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏优化问题中的阈值算法需要平衡搜索方向和阈值策略的效率。传统牛顿方法计算成本高，需要找到既能保持牛顿方法效率又能降低计算复杂度的新方向。

Method: 使用压缩牛顿方向作为搜索方向，将经典牛顿步限制在低维子空间并通过对角正则化嵌入全空间。基于此提出了CNHTP（硬阈值）和CNOTP（最优阈值）两类算法。

Result: 在限制等距性质下建立了算法的全局收敛性。实验结果表明，在稀疏优化问题的成功频率和解精度方面，所提算法与多种最先进方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 压缩牛顿方向方法有效降低了计算成本，同时保持了牛顿类方法的效率，为稀疏优化问题提供了高效的求解方案。

Abstract: Thresholding algorithms for sparse optimization problems involve two key
components: search directions and thresholding strategies. In this paper, we
use the compressed Newton direction as a search direction, derived by confining
the classical Newton step to a low-dimensional subspace and embedding it back
into the full space with diagonal regularization. This approach significantly
reduces the computational cost for finding the search direction while
maintaining the efficiency of Newton-like methods. Based on this new search
direction, we propose two major classes of algorithms by adopting hard or
optimal thresholding: the compressed Newton-direction-based thresholding
pursuit (CNHTP) and compressed Newton-direction-based optimal thresholding
pursuit (CNOTP). We establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithms
under the restricted isometry property. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms perform comparably to several state-of-the-art methods
in terms of success frequency and solution accuracy for solving the sparse
optimization problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代MIMO系统面临复杂近场传播、连续孔径建模、亚波长天线耦合效应等挑战，传统模型驱动和深度学习方法难以处理这些新体制下的巨大计算复杂度和模型不准确性。

Method: 采用傅里叶神经算子(FNO)，该算子学习无限维函数空间之间的函数到函数映射，特别适合基于电磁波传播偏微分方程建模复杂物理系统，具有网格无关性和在傅里叶域高效捕获全局依赖的能力。

Result: 在新型MIMO架构的信道建模和估计案例研究中，FNO相比最先进方法展现出优越性能。

Conclusion: FNO是推动下一代MIMO系统巨大潜力的有前景技术，文章讨论了开放挑战并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Next-generation multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, characterized
by extremely large-scale arrays, holographic surfaces, three-dimensional
architectures, and flexible antennas, are poised to deliver unprecedented data
rates, spectral efficiency and stability. However, these advancements introduce
significant challenges for physical layer signal processing, stemming from
complex near-field propagation, continuous aperture modeling, sub-wavelength
antenna coupling effects, and dynamic channel conditions. Conventional
model-based and deep learning approaches often struggle with the immense
computational complexity and model inaccuracies inherent in these new regimes.
This article proposes a Fourier neural operator (FNO) as a powerful and
promising tool to address these challenges. The FNO learns function-to-function
mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, making them
exceptionally well-suited for modeling complex physical systems governed by
partial differential equations based on electromagnetic wave propagation. We
first present the fundamental principles of FNO, demonstrating its mesh-free
nature and function-to-function ability to efficiently capture global
dependencies in the Fourier domain. Furthermore, we explore a range of
applications of FNO in physical-layer signal processing for next-generation
MIMO systems. Representative case studies on channel modeling and estimation
for novel MIMO architectures demonstrate the superior performance of FNO
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and
outline future research directions, positioning FNO as a promising technology
for enabling the enormous potential of next-generation MIMO systems.

Motivation: 解决多智能体协作优化时保护各自可行集隐私的问题，避免通过私有集合交集协议直接获取联合可行集导致的信息泄露超过必要范围。

Method: 设计领导者与非领导者之间的查询-应答协议，在环状和星状网络结构下，通过精心设计的通信方案获取最优解集，同时限制信息泄露至仅解集本身所揭示的内容。

Result: 提出的方案能以名义信息泄露获取解集，相比直接使用私有集合交集协议，在大多数情况下通信效率更高，且避免了额外的信息泄露。

Conclusion: 该工作为隐私保护的分布式优化提供了有效方案，建立了与阈值私有集合交集的联系，并展示了在随机目标函数下通信效率的优势。

Abstract: We consider the problem of decentralized constrained optimization with
multiple agents $E_1,\ldots,E_N$ who jointly wish to learn the optimal solution
set while keeping their feasible sets $\mathcal{P}_1,\ldots,\mathcal{P}_N$
private from each other. We assume that the objective function $f$ is known to
all agents and each feasible set is a collection of points from a universal
alphabet $\mathcal{P}_{alph}$. A designated agent (leader) starts the
communication with the remaining (non-leader) agents, and is the first to
retrieve the solution set. The leader searches for the solution by sending
queries to and receiving answers from the non-leaders, such that the
information on the individual feasible sets revealed to the leader should be no
more than nominal, i.e., what is revealed from learning the solution set alone.
We develop achievable schemes for obtaining the solution set at nominal
information leakage, and characterize their communication costs under two
communication setups between agents. In this work, we focus on two kinds of
network setups: i) ring, where each agent communicates with two adjacent
agents, and ii) star, where only the leader communicates with the remaining
agents. We show that, if the leader first learns the joint feasible set through
an existing private set intersection (PSI) protocol and then deduces the
solution set, the information leaked to the leader is greater than nominal.
Moreover, we draw connection of our schemes to threshold PSI (ThPSI), which is
a PSI-variant where the intersection is revealed only when its cardinality is
larger than a threshold value. Finally, for various realizations of $f$ mapped
uniformly at random to a fixed range of values, our schemes are more
communication-efficient with a high probability compared to retrieving the
entire feasible set through PSI.

TL;DR: COMET框架通过偏移二进制编码技术优化CNN设计，实现性能与资源利用的协同优化，显著降低FPGA资源消耗且保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在计算机视觉中表现优异，但其计算密集性和对FPGA等硬件的依赖限制了在低功耗边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 采用偏移二进制编码分别表示输入和权重，利用位宽不对称性；修改移位累加操作，引入四种新颖的LUT技术；开发基于OBC的通用矩阵乘法核心。

Result: FPGA评估显示，相比现有LeNet-5 CNN设计，该方法显著减少资源利用率，对精度影响极小。

Conclusion: COMET框架成功实现了CNN在边缘设备上的高效部署，为低功耗应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for computer vision
and pattern recognition tasks; however, their computational intensity and
reliance on hardware such as FPGAs pose challenges for deployment on low-power
edge devices. In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that
employ efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable
co-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach
formulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and
weights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry.
The shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term
with the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we
introduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split,
and hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building
on this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core
using the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a
fixed-point modified LeNet-5 model. FPGA evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed co-optimization approach significantly reduces resource utilization
compared to state-of-the-art LeNet-5 based CNN designs, with minimal impact on
accuracy.

Motivation: 传统Jakes模型分析困难，而简化的常数相关模型无法准确捕捉FAS端口的空间相关性，导致安全分析精度不足。

Method: 采用变量块相关模型(VBCM)框架，推导平均保密容量和保密中断概率的闭式表达式，并设计网格搜索和梯度下降两种优化算法。

Result: VBCM框架实现与仿真对齐的精度，相对误差低于5%，在高威胁场景下ASC提升超过120%，紧凑天线配置性能提升18-19%。

Conclusion: VBCM为FAS安全分析和优化提供了强大工具，对推进6G通信系统具有重要实践价值。

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) are emerging as a transformative enabler for
sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications, providing unprecedented spatial
diversity through dynamic reconfiguration of antenna ports. However, the
inherent spatial correlation among ports poses significant challenges for
accurate analysis. Conventional models such as Jakes are analytically
intractable, while oversimplified constant-correlation models fail to capture
the true behavior. In this work, we address these challenges by applying the
variable block-correlation model (VBCM) -- originally proposed by
Ram\'{i}rez-Espinosa \textit{et al.} in 2024 -- to FAS security analysis, and
by developing comprehensive optimization methods to enhance analytical
accuracy. We derive new closed-form expressions for average secrecy capacity
(ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP), demonstrating that the VBCM
framework achieves simulation-aligned accuracy, with relative errors
consistently below $5\%$ (compared to $10$--$15\%$ for constant-correlation
models). To maximize ASC, we further design two algorithms: a grid search (GS)
method and a gradient descent (GD) method. Numerical results reveal that the
VBCM-based approach not only provides reliable insights into FAS security
performance, but also yields substantial gains -- ASC improvements exceeding
$120\%$ in high-threat scenarios and $18$--$19\%$ performance enhancements for
compact antenna configurations. These findings underscore the practical value
of integrating VBCM into FAS security analysis and optimization, establishing
it as a powerful tool for advancing 6G communication systems.

Conclusion: 提出的等效网格模型能够更好地弥合实际物理信道与理论网格模型之间的差距，为双选择性信道通信提供了更准确的建模框架。

Abstract: Significant studies on communications over doubly selective channels have
utilized on-grid DD channel models, which are previously investigated in
Bello's seminar paper in 1963. The DD grid is typically specified by the
bandwidth and time duration of the transmission frames. However, the physical
channels are determined by the propagation environments and they are typically
off-grid. Hence, there is often a gap between an actual physical channel and
the on-grid model. This paper revisits the on-grid modeling of practical
physical channels. We study the associated on-grid DD-domain representations
for continuous-time, doubly selective channels with off-grid delay and Doppler
shifts, accounting for practical time/frequency-domain windowing at the
transceivers. The universal models obtained are applicable under the mild
assumption that the windows have finite supports, and they extend Bello's
classical results to account for more general windows. We also discuss the
features and implications of the equivalent on-grid models.

Abstract: A pinching antenna system (PASS) assisted cell-free communication system is
proposed. A sum rate maximization problem under the BS power budget constraint
and PA deployment constraint is formulated. To tackle the proposed non-convex

In particular, the digital beamforming sub-problem is solved using the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method, whereas the pinching beamforming
sub-problem is handled via a penalty based approach combined with element-wise
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the PASS assisted
cell-free systems achieve superior performance over benchmark schemes; 2)
increasing the number of PAs per waveguides can improve the advantage of PASS
assisted cell-free systems; and 3) the cell-free architecture mitigates the
average user rate degradation as the number of users increases.

Abstract: In this paper, sensing-assisted secure communication in a multi-user
multi-eavesdropper integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is
investigated. Confidential communication signals and dedicated sensing signals
are jointly transmitted by a base station (BS) to simultaneously serve users
and sense aerial eavesdroppers (AEs). A sum rate maximization problem is
formulated under AEs' Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and
sensing Signal-to-Clutter-plus-Noise Ratio (SCNR) constraints. A
fractional-programming-based alternating optimization algorithm is developed to
solve this problem for fully digital arrays, where successive convex
approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are leveraged to handle
non-convex constraints. Furthermore, the minimum number of dedicated sensing
beams is analyzed via a worst-case rank bound, upon which the proposed
beamforming design is further extended to the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) array
architecture, where the unit-modulus constraint is addressed by manifold
optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that only a small number of
sensing beams are sufficient for both sensing and jamming AEs, and the proposed
designs consistently outperform strong baselines while also revealing the
communication-sensing trade-off.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major pediatric health burden, and early
screening is of critical importance. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a
noninvasive and accessible tool, is well suited for this purpose. This paper
presents the first benchmark study of deep learning for multi-label pediatric
CVD classification on the recently released ZZU-pECG dataset, comprising 3716
recordings with 19 CVD categories. We systematically evaluate four
representative paradigms--ResNet-1D, BiLSTM, Transformer, and Mamba 2--under
both 9-lead and 12-lead configurations. All models achieved strong results,
with Hamming Loss as low as 0.0069 and F1-scores above 85% in most settings.
ResNet-1D reached a macro-F1 of 94.67% on the 12-lead subset, while BiLSTM and
Transformer also showed competitive performance. Per-class analysis indicated
challenges for rare conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the
9-lead subset, reflecting the effect of limited positive samples. This
benchmark establishes reusable baselines and highlights complementary strengths
across paradigms. It further points to the need for larger-scale, multi-center
validation, age-stratified analysis, and broader disease coverage to support
real-world pediatric ECG applications.

Abstract: Frequency Range 3 (FR3) in the 7-24 GHz band will be the new spectrum for 6G
wireless networks. The bandwidth availability and diversity of FR3 offer
unprecedented opportunities for coherent multiband Integrated Sensing and
Communications (ISAC), which aggregates the carrier phase information from
multiple frequency bands to increase the sensing resolution to the cm-level.
However, the frequency anisotropy of sensing targets over GHz-wide bands and
the non-contiguity of the 6G spectrum, pose critical challenges to the
application of existing multiband ISAC techniques. We present the first study
on coherent multiband sensing in FR3. We experimentally characterize the
frequency anisotropy of targets and propose new phase coherence metrics for
multiband processing. Then, we analyze the impact of non-contiguous FR3 bands
considered by 3GPP, and design a new algorithm to mitigate the resulting
sensing artifacts, outperforming existing techniques. Our results represent a
first step toward fully developing multiband ISAC for FR3.

Abstract: Source polar coding is a potential solution for short blocklength-based
low-latency key generation with limited sources, which is a critical aspect of
six generation (6G) Internet of things. However, existing source coding schemes
still suffer from significant degradation in key generation rate and
reconciliation reliability in short blocklength regime. To address this issue,
we introduce a multilevel source polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC)
coding framework. Furthermore, we propose a novel code construction algorithm
that jointly leverages polarization effects and the maximum likelihood (ML)
decoding error coefficient. Simulations demonstrate that the multilevel source
PAC scheme with the proposed code construction achieves superior key generation
rate under key disagreement constraints compared to conventional and multilevel
source polar coding methods even in short blocklength regimes.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. However, the propagation mediums in practical MI based underground
emergency communications are usually diverse and composed randomly due to the
impact of disasters, which poses a challenge for MI communication in practical
applications. In this paper, we formulate a statistical fading channel model,
which reflects the random composition of diverse mediums and is shown to follow
a lognormal distribution. To mitigate the impact of diverse medium fading,
Multi-frequency Resonating Compensation (MuReC) based coils are used to achieve
multiband transmission. Then, we analyze the performance of MuReC based
multi-band MI communication with diverse medium fading and derive the
expressions of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density functions,
ergodic capacities, average bit error rates (BERs), and outage probabilities
for both multiplexing and diversity cases. Numerical results show that MuReC
based multiband transmission schemes can effectively reduce the impact of
diverse medium fading and enhance the performance.

Abstract: The sum of random variables (RVs) appears extensively in wireless
communications, at large, both conventional and advanced, and has been subject
of longstanding research. The statistical characterization of the referred sum
is crucial to determine the performance of such communications systems.
Although efforts have been undertaken to unveil these sum statistics, e.g.,
probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF),
no general efficient nor manageable solutions capable of evaluating the exact
sum PDF and CDF are available to date. The only formulations are given in terms
of either the multi-fold Brennan's integral or the multivariate Fox H-function.
Unfortunately, these methods are only feasible up to a certain number of RVs,
meaning that when the number of RVs in the sum increases, the computation of
the sum PDF and CDF is subject to stability problems, convergence issues, or
inaccurate results. In this paper, we derive new, simple, exact formulations
for the PDF and CDF of the sum of L independent and identically distributed
{\alpha}-{\mu} RVs. Unlike the available solutions, the computational
complexity of our analytical expressions is independent of the number of
summands. Capitalizing on our unprecedented findings, we analyze, in exact and
asymptotic manners, the performance of L-branch pre-detection equal-gain
combining and maximal-ratio combining receivers over {\alpha}-{\mu} fading
environments. The coding and diversity gains of the system for both receivers
are analyzed and quantified. Moreover, numerical simulations show that the
computation time reduces drastically when using our expressions, which are
arguably the most efficient and manageable formulations derived so far.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication is an effective underground emergency
communication technique after disasters such as landslides, mine collapses, and
earthquakes, due to its advantages in mediums such as soil, concrete, and
metals. Based on channel state information (CSI), magnetic beamforming can
significantly improve the performance of MI communication. However, in
post-disaster underground communication, channel estimation may suffer from
errors due to factors such as complex environmental interferences. Taking
channel estimation error into account, we formulate a beamforming optimization
problem for multi-user MI underground emergency communications, which aims to
minimize the power consumption under the constraints of sum rate and signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of each user. Based on the worst-case
optimization criterion and the S-procedure, the non-convex optimization problem
is transformed into convex and solved. Numerical results show that the proposed
robust beamforming scheme can effectively enhance communication reliability and
effective throughput in the presence of channel estimation errors.

Result: AFDM在非白噪声环境下表现优于OTFS和OFDM，性能增益超过1dB，其解调矩阵稀疏度较低，具有更好的噪声白化能力。

Conclusion: AFDM调制方案在非白高斯噪声环境下具有最佳性能，适用于窄带信号和与OFDM信号共存等应用场景。

Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of affine frequency division
multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation
schemes against non-white Gaussian noise, which can model various sources of
additive disturbances to the received signal. The proposed approach
demonstrates that the performance of these waveforms depends on the ability of
the demodulation matrix to whiten the noise-a property that is, in turn,
related to the sparsity of the matrix. AFDM is shown to outperform OTFS and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as its demodulation matrix
is generally less sparse than those of the other waveforms. Based on this
analysis, several application examples and use cases are presented, such as the
use of AFDM and OTFS in narrowband signals or in coexistence with OFDM signals.
Finally, simulation results confirm that AFDM achieves better performance than
OTFS and OFDM in the presence of non-white noise, with gains exceeding 1 dB in
most application scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注位置和速度估计，缺乏对加速度的估计能力，需要扩展传统框架以更全面地描述移动目标运动学。

Method: 首先使用TOA技术估计位置，然后开发重新表述的最小二乘和加权最小二乘方法进行速度估计，最后利用距离率导数结合先前的位置和速度估计来估计加速度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与现有方法相比，该方法在估计移动目标运动学方面提供了改进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了传统目标跟踪框架，能够同时估计位置、速度和加速度，为移动目标运动学分析提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: This letter presents a novel method for estimating the position, velocity,
and acceleration of a moving target using range-based measurements. Although
most existing studies focus on position and velocity estimation, the framework
of this letter is extended to include acceleration. To achieve this, we propose
using the derivative of the range rate, in addition to the range and range rate
measurements. The proposed method estimates the position at first using
Time-of-Arrival (TOA)-based techniques; then, develops a reformulated least
squares (LS) and weighted least squares (WLS) approaches for velocity
estimation; and finally, employs the derivative of the range rate to estimate
the acceleration using previous position and velocity estimates. On the other
hand, closed-form LS and WLS solutions are derived for both velocity and
acceleration. The simulation results show that the proposed approach provides
improved performance in estimating moving target kinematics compared to
existing methods.

Motivation: 解决在传感器网络中使用最少传感器进行移动源定位的问题，特别适用于计算资源受限的物联网应用如无人机追踪和智能交通。

Method: 两阶段估计器：第一阶段引入辅助参数构建伪线性方程并加权最小二乘求解，通过Sylvester结式代数消元得到闭式解；第二阶段线性细化减少残余偏差。

Result: 在2D和3D场景的蒙特卡洛仿真中，位置和速度估计达到CRLB级别的精度，性能优于代表性两阶段和迭代基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR方法使用理论最小传感器数量，计算高效且统计有效，特别适合功率受限的分布式物联网应用。

Abstract: This paper presents CLEAR -- a closed-form localization estimator with a
reduced sensor network. The proposed method is a computationally efficient,
two-stage estimator that fuses time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and
frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements with a minimal number of
sensors. CLEAR localizes a moving source in N-dimensional space using only N+1
sensors, achieving the theoretical minimum sensor count. The first stage
introduces auxiliary range and range-rate parameters to construct a set of
pseudo-linear equations, solved via weighted least squares. An algebraic
elimination using Sylvester's resultant then reduces the problem to a quartic
equation, yielding closed-form estimates for the nuisance variables. A second,
lightweight linear refinement stage is applied to mitigate residual bias. Under
mild Gaussian noise assumptions, the estimator's position and velocity
estimates are statistically efficient, closely approaching the Cramer-Rao lower
bound (CRLB). Extensive Monte Carlo simulations in 2-D and 3-D scenarios
demonstrate CRLB-level accuracy and consistent performance gains over
representative two-stage and iterative baselines, confirming the method's high
suitability for power-constrained, distributed Internet of Things (IoT)
applications such as UAV tracking and smart transportation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating multistatic coherent
imaging functionalities in the downlink (DL) of a phase-coherent distributed
multiple input multiple output (D-MIMO) communication network. During DL, the
D-MIMO access points (APs) jointly precode the transmitted signals to maximize
the spectral efficiency (SE) at the users (UEs) locations. However, imaging
requires that \textit{(i)} a fraction of the APs work as receivers for sensing
and \textit{(ii)} the transmitting APs emit AP-specific and orthogonal signals
to illuminate the area to be imaged and allow multistatic operation. In these
settings, our contribution is twofold. We propose a novel distributed
integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system that superposes a
purposely designed AP-specific signal for imaging to the legacy UE-specific
communication one, with a tunable trade-off factor. We detail both the imaging
waveform design according to the \textit{extended orthogonality condition} and
the space-frequency precoder design. Then, we propose an optimized selection
strategy for the receiving APs, in order to maximize imaging performance under
half-duplex constraints. Extensive numerical results prove the feasibility and
benefits of our proposal, materializing the potential of joint multistatic
imaging and communications in practical D-MIMO deployments.

Motivation: 现有模型在太赫兹通信中难以处理严重的频率选择性和多径效应，需要更准确的信道建模来支持6G室内网络的实现。

Conclusion: 该方法为太赫兹系统设计提供了坚实基础，支持可靠的室内无线个人区域网络、设备到设备通信和未来6G应用中的精确定位，同时强调了带宽在抑制振荡伪影和提高建模精度中的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate channel modeling is essential for realizing the potential of
terahertz (THz) communications in 6G indoor networks, where existing models
struggle with severe frequency selectivity and multipath effects. We propose a
physically grounded Rician fading channel model that jointly incorporates
deterministic line-of-sight (LOS) and stochastic non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
components, enhanced by frequency-dependent attenuation characterized by
optimized exponents alpha and beta. Unlike conventional approaches, our model
integrates a two-ray reflection framework to capture standing wave phenomena
and employs wideband spectral averaging to mitigate frequency selectivity over
bandwidths up to 15 GHz. Empirical measurements at a 208 GHz carrier, spanning
0.1-0.9 m, demonstrate that our model achieves root mean square errors (RMSE)
as low as 2.54 dB, outperforming free-space path loss (FSPL) by up to 14.2% and
reducing RMSE by 73.3% as bandwidth increases. These findings underscore the
importance of bandwidth in suppressing oscillatory artifacts and improving
modeling accuracy. Our approach provides a robust foundation for THz system
design, supporting reliable indoor wireless personal area networks (WPANs),
device-to-device (D2D) communications, and precise localization in future 6G
applications.

Abstract: In 6G wireless networks, multi-modal ML models can be leveraged to enable
situation-aware network decisions in dynamic environments. However, trained ML
models often fail to generalize under domain shifts when training and test data
distributions are different because they often focus on modality-specific
spurious features. In practical wireless systems, domain shifts occur
frequently due to dynamic channel statistics, moving obstacles, or hardware
configuration. Thus, there is a need for learning frameworks that can achieve
robust generalization under scarce multi-modal data in wireless networks. In
this paper, a novel and data-efficient two-phase learning framework is proposed
to improve generalization performance in unseen and unfamiliar wireless
environments with minimal amount of multi-modal data. In the first stage, a
physics-based loss function is employed to enable each BS to learn the physics
underlying its wireless environment captured by multi-modal data. The
data-efficiency of the physics-based loss function is analytically
investigated. In the second stage, collaborative domain adaptation is proposed
to leverage the wireless environment knowledge of multiple BSs to guide
under-performing BSs under domain shift. Specifically, domain-similarity-aware
model aggregation is proposed to utilize the knowledge of BSs that experienced
similar domains. To validate the proposed framework, a new dataset generation
framework is developed by integrating CARLA and MATLAB-based mmWave channel
modeling to predict mmWave RSS. Simulation results show that the proposed
physics-based training requires only 13% of data samples to achieve the same
performance as a state-of-the-art baseline that does not use physics-based
training. Moreover, the proposed collaborative domain adaptation needs only 25%
of data samples and 20% of FLOPs to achieve the convergence compared to
baselines.

Conclusion: 基于低秩矩阵近似的方案能有效提升忆阻器交叉阵列的计算精度，误差分析为方案优化提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Memristor crossbars enable vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), and are
promising for low-power applications. However, it can be difficult to write the
memristor conductance values exactly. To improve the accuracy of VMM, we
propose a scheme based on low-rank matrix approximation. Specifically, singular
value decomposition (SVD) is first applied to obtain a low-rank approximation
of the target matrix, which is then factored into a pair of smaller matrices.
Subsequently, a two-step serial VMM is executed, where the stochastic write
errors are mitigated through step-wise averaging. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed scheme, we derive a general expression for the resulting
computation error and provide an asymptotic analysis under a prescribed
singular-value profile, which reveals how the error scales with matrix size and
rank. Both analytical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the
proposed scheme compared with the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: In recent decades Human Body Communication has emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional radio wave communication, utilizing the body's
conductive properties for low-power connectivity among wearables. This method
harnesses the human body as an energy-efficient channel for data transmission
within the electro-quasistatic frequency range, enabling advancements in
human-machine interaction. While prior work has noted the role of parasitic
return paths in such capacitively coupled systems, the influence of surrounding
metallic objects on these paths, which are critical for EQS wireless signaling,
has not been fully explored. This paper fills that gap with a structured study
of how various conducting objects, from non-grounded (floating) metals and
grounded metals to enclosed metallic environments such as elevators and cars,
affect the body-communication channel. We present a theoretical framework
supported by finite element method simulations and experiments with wearable
devices. Results show that metallic objects within 20 cm of devices can reduce
transmission loss by about 10 dB. When a device ground connects to a grounded
metallic object, channel gain can increase by at least 20 dB. Contact area
during touch-based interactions with grounded metals produces contact-impedance
dependent high-pass channel characteristics. Proximity to metallic objects
introduces variability within a critical distance, with grounded metals
producing a larger overall effect than floating metals. These findings improve
understanding of body-centric communication links and inform design for
healthcare, consumer electronics, defense, and industrial applications.

Abstract: Caching is crucial in hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks to reduce
latency, optimize throughput, and improve data availability by storing
frequently accessed content closer to users, especially in bandwidth-limited
satellite systems, requiring strategic Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. This
paper addresses throughput optimization in satellite-terrestrial integrated

satellite-terrestrial hybrid links and caching probing. Our threshold-based
strategy optimizes probing and scheduling, significantly improving average
system throughput by exploiting cooperative caching, satellite-terrestrial link
transmission, and time diversity from dynamic user requests. Simulation results

Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) has emerged as a promising solution for future
wireless systems by enabling ultra-dense, spatially continuous antenna
deployments. While prior studies have primarily focused on electromagnetic (EM)
modeling or simulation-based performance analysis, a rigorous
communication-theoretic framework remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents the first analytical performance study of a multi-user HMIMO downlink
system with matched filter (MF) precoding - a low-complexity baseline scheme.
By incorporating multipath propagation, mutual coupling, and element
excitation, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the MF
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) using an equivalent random
variable model. Leveraging bivariate gamma distributions, we then develop
tractable throughput approximations under full, partial, and no channel state
information (CSI) scenarios. Additionally, we formulate a max-min beamforming
problem to benchmark optimal user fairness performance. Numerical results
validate the accuracy of the proposed framework and reveal that MF precoding
achieves competitive performance with strong robustness to low SINR and CSI
uncertainty.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了网络化集成感知与通信中的协调波束成形设计，重点关注基于到达时间(ToA)的多目标监测终端定位问题，提出了多种优化算法来解决感知中心和通信中心的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络化集成感知与通信(ISAC)作为下一代无线系统的关键技术，将感知信号接收委托给专用目标监测终端(TMTs)而非基站(BSs)可以显著提升感知能力和部署灵活性，但相关的协调波束成形设计尚未得到充分研究。

Result: 仿真结果验证了所提算法的有效性，揭示了通信与定位之间的内在性能权衡，并表明在网络化ISAC系统中部署更多TMTs比部署更多BSs更具优势。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了网络化集成通信与基于ToA的多TMT定位协调波束成形设计的空白，为下一代无线系统的感知通信一体化提供了有效的解决方案和设计指导。

Abstract: Networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained significant
attention as a promising technology for enabling next-generation wireless
systems. To further enhance networked ISAC, delegating the reception of sensing
signals to dedicated target monitoring terminals (TMTs) instead of base
stations (BSs) offers significant advantages in terms of sensing capability and
deployment flexibility. Despite its potential, the coordinated beamforming
design for networked integrated communication and time-of-arrival (ToA)-based
multi-TMT localization remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive study to fill this gap. Specifically, we first establish signal
models for both communication and localization, and, for the first time, derive
a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize the localization
performance. Subsequently, we exploit this CRLB to formulate two optimization
problems, focusing on sensing-centric and communication-centric criteria,
respectively. For the sensing-centric problem, we develop a globally optimal
algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) when each BS is equipped with
more antennas than the total number of communication users. While for the
communication-centric problem, we design a globally optimal algorithm for the
single-BS case using bisection search. For the general case of both problems,
we propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,
which is suboptimal yet efficient, and further extend it from single-target
scenarios to more practical multi-target scenarios. Finally, simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, reveal the intrinsic
performance trade-offs between communication and localization, and further show
that deploying more TMTs is always preferable to deploying more BSs in
networked ISAC systems.

Abstract: Unitary matrices are the basis of a large number of signal processing
applications. In many of these applications, finding ways to efficiently store,
and even transmit these matrices, can significantly reduce memory and
throughput requirements. In this work, we study the problem of efficient
transmission and storage of unitary matrices. Specifically, we explicitly
derive a dimensionally-efficient parametrization (DEP) for unitary matrices
that allows identifying them with sequences of real numbers, where the
dimension coincides with the dimension of the unitary group where they lie. We
also characterize its inverse map that allows retrieving the original unitary
matrices from their DEP. The proposed approach effectively allows halving the
dimension with respect to naively considering all the entries of each unitary
matrix, thus reducing the resources required to store and transmit these
matrices. Furthermore, we show that the sequence of real numbers associated to
the proposed DEP is bounded, and we delimit the interval where these numbers
are contained, facilitating the implementation of quantization approaches with
limited distortion. On the other hand, we outline ways to further reduce the
dimension of the DEP when considering more restrictive constraints for matrices
that show up in certain applications. The numerical results showcase the
potential of the proposed approach in general settings, as well as in three
specific applications of current interest for wireless communications research.

Conclusion: BD-RIS是未来多层非地面网络的有前景的使能技术，能够有效提升系统性能并抑制干扰。

Abstract: In this work, we study a multi-user NTN in which a satellite serves as the
primary network and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) operates as the
secondary network, acting as a cognitive radio. To reduce the cost, complexity,
and power consumption of conventional antenna arrays, we equip the HAPS with a
transmissive BD-RIS antenna front end. We then formulate a joint optimization
problem for the BD-RIS phase response and the HAPS transmit power allocation
under strict per-user interference temperature constraints. To tackle the
resulting highly nonconvex problem, we propose an alternating-optimization
framework: the power-allocation subproblem admits a closed-form,
water-filling-type solution derived from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions, while the BD-RIS configuration is refined via Riemannian manifold
optimization. Simulation results show significant gains in data rate and
interference suppression over diagonal RIS-assisted benchmarks, establishing
BD-RIS as a promising enabler for future multilayer NTNs.

Conclusion: 所提出的干扰对齐方案有效解决了多集群AirComp系统中的干扰问题，提高了信道利用效率，特别适用于密集IoT网络环境。

Abstract: One of the main challenges facing Internet of Things (IoT) networks is
managing interference caused by the large number of devices communicating
simultaneously, particularly in multi-cluster networks where multiple devices
simultaneously transmit to their respective receiver. Over-the-Air Computation
(AirComp) has emerged as a promising solution for efficient real-time data
aggregation, yet its performance suffers in dense, interference-limited
environments. To address this, we propose a novel Interference Alignment (IA)
scheme tailored for up-link AirComp systems. Unlike previous approaches, the
proposed method scales to an arbitrary number $\sf K$ of clusters and enables
each cluster to exploit half of the available channels, instead of only
$\tfrac{1}{\sf K}$ as in time-sharing. In addition, we develop schemes tailored
to scenarios where users are shared between adjacent clusters.

Abstract: In every imaging or sensing application, the physical hardware creates
constraints that must be overcome or they limit system performance. Techniques
that leverage additional degrees of freedom can effectively extend performance
beyond the inherent physical capabilities of the hardware. An example includes
synchronizing distributed sensors so as to synthesize a larger aperture for
remote sensing applications. An additional example is integrating the
communication and sensing functions in a wireless system through the clever
design of waveforms and optimized resource management. As these technologies
mature beyond the conceptual and prototype phase they will ultimately
transition to the commercial market. Here, standards play a critical role in
ensuring success. Standards ensure interoperability between systems
manufactured by different vendors and define industry best practices for
vendors and customers alike. The Signal Processing Society of the Institute for
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) plays a leading role in developing
high-quality standards for computational sensing technologies through the
working groups of the Synthetic Aperture Standards Committee (SASC). In this
column we highlight the standards activities of the P3383 Performance Metrics
for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Systems Working Group and the
P3343 Spatio-Temporal Synchronization of a Synthetic Aperture of Distributed
Sensors Working Group.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图上的扩散过程在拉普拉斯正则化设计的初始模式下能偏离多远，给出了稳态扩散的闭式上界，分离了图最大节点度的影响和设计控制项的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究拉普拉斯正则化设计的模式在扩散过程中的稳定性，特别是在阵列波束成形等应用中，需要了解稳态偏差的上界。

Method: 在无向、非负图的标准稳定性条件下，推导出稳态扩散相对于初始模式的相对变化的闭式上界，分离了不可约项和设计控制项。

Result: 得到了一个非渐近、易于计算的保证，证明稳态偏差可以通过增加正则化强度来控制，遵循逆平方根定律。

Conclusion: 提出了一个简单的设计规则：给定任何扩散限制目标，可以闭式选择足够的正则化强度来保证稳态偏差在可控范围内。

Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can drift from a designed
starting pattern when that pattern is produced using Laplacian regularisation.
Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative
graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the
steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and
initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term
determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled
term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (following an
inverse square-root law). This leads to a simple design rule: given any target
limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed
form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming, where the
initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights, the result
applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then
evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is
non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies how much steady-state deviation
can occur.
