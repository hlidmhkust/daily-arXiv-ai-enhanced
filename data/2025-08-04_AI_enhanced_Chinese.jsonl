It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,\nmainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use\ntime-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key\nmodulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication\nconditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a\nlarge amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.\nTo solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called\nRIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from\nunlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking\nand reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as\namplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable\nrepresentations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets.

However, the\npowerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM)\nprovides a promising approach.

In this paper, we present a VLM-driven\ncontrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates\nmultimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal\nconsistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and\nLiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts\nand connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which\nfurther improves cross-modal consistency.

This paper introduces a breakthrough\nLO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA\nreceivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients.

To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques\nare commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite\ngrowing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on\nprotocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the\nfundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal\nbounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,\nwhere no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the\nproblem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic\nperspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,\neach holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who\naim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires\nthat no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up\nto $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies\nthe minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols.
