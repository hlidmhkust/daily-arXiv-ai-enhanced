This makes training and particularly fine-tuning of machine-learned codecs on this metric interesting. However, VMAF is shown to be attackable in a way that, e.g., unsharpening an image can lead to a gain in VMAF quality while decreasing the quality in human perception. A particular version of VMAF called VMAF NEG has been designed to be more robust against such attacks and therefore it should be more useful for fine-tuning of codecs. In this paper, our contributions are threefold. First, we identify and analyze the still existing vulnerability of VMAF NEG towards attacks, particulary towards the attack that consists in employing VMAF NEG for image codec fine-tuning. Second, to benefit from VMAF NEG's high correlation with human perception, we propose a robust loss including VMAF NEG for fine-tuning either the encoder or the decoder. Third, we support our quantitative objective results by providing perceptive impressions of some image examples."}

However, routine acquisition of multi-tracer PET is limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and restricted tracer availability. Recent efforts have explored deep learning approaches for synthesizing PET images from structural MRI. While some methods rely solely on T1-weighted MRI, others incorporate additional sequences such as T2-FLAIR to improve pathological sensitivity. However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained anatomical and pathological details, resulting in artifacts and unrealistic outputs. To this end, we propose RelA-Diffusion, a Relativistic Adversarial Diffusion framework for multi-tracer PET synthesis from multi-sequence MRI. By leveraging both T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR scans as complementary inputs, RelA-Diffusion captures richer structural information to guide image generation. To improve synthesis fidelity, we introduce a gradient-penalized relativistic adversarial loss to the intermediate clean predictions of the diffusion model. This loss compares real and generated images in a relative manner, encouraging the synthesis of more realistic local structures. Both the relativistic formulation and the gradient penalty contribute to stabilizing the training, while adversarial feedback at each diffusion timestep enables consistent refinement throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that RelA-Diffusion outperforms existing methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics, highlighting its potential for accurate synthesis of multi-tracer PET."}

In the perspective of information, twin-image super-resolution (TISR) is regarded as the most challenging MISR scenario, having crucial applications like the SPOT-5 supermode imaging. In TISR, an image is super-resolved by its subpixel-shift counterpart (i.e., twin image), where the two images are typically offset by half a pixel both horizontally and vertically. We formulate the less investigated TISR using a convex criterion, which is implemented using a novel deep unfolding network. In the unfolding, an embedded simple shift operator trickily addresses the coupled TISR data-fitting terms, and a transformer trained with a convex self-similarity loss function elegantly implements the proximal mapping induced by the TISR regularizer. The proposed convex self-similarity unfolding supermode super-resolution (COSUP) algorithm is interpretable and achieves state-of-the-art performance with very fast millisecond-level computational time. COSUP is also tested on real-world data, for which the subpixel shifts would not be spatially uniform, with results showing great superiority over the official CNES supermode imaging product in terms of credible metrics (e.g., natural image quality evaluator, NIQE).

The transition from planar far-field communications to spherical near-field propagation necessitates novel channel estimation algorithms to fully exploit the unique features of spherical wavefronts for advanced transceiver design. To this end, we propose a novel semi-gridless channel estimation approach based on a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework. Specifically, we reformulate the near-field channel model for both uniform linear arrays and uniform planar arrays into separate direction-of-arrival (DoAs) and distance components. Building on these new representations, we employ a gridless approach for DoAs estimation using a von Mises distribution, and a coarse-to-fine grid search for distance estimation. We then develop a semi-gridless variational Bayesian (SG-VB) algorithm with efficient update rules that enables accurate channel reconstruction. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SG-VB algorithm, demonstrating enhanced near-field channel reconstruction accuracy and superior estimation performance for both DoAs and distance components embedded in near-field channels."}

By means of improved network design and dedicated training strategies, we extend the method to achieve filter-permutation invariance as well as the possibility to change the convolutional dictionary at inference time. We apply our method to low-field MRI and compare it to several other recent deep learning-based methods, also on in vivo data, in which the benefit for the use of a different dictionary is showcased. We further assess the method's robustness when tested on in- and out-of-distribution data. When tested on the latter, the proposed method suffers less from the data distribution shift compared to the other learned methods, which we attribute to its reduced reliance on training data due to its underlying model-based reconstruction component."}

In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming.

Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users."}

The present paper addresses the challenges to perform delay-synchronous channel sounding using off-the-shelf multiple-antenna IEEE 802.11ax WiFi devices, referred to as SoundiFi. Stable delay synchronization and power level reference are realized by remoting the antennas with coaxial cables and devoting one of the antennas as a reference channel, with which the gain and delay of other simultaneous channels are defined. Indoor experiments confirmed that the impulse response becomes continuous across successive acquisitions and provide the absolute delay. The impulse response has a noise level at -115 dB, indicating the maximum path gain value that can be measured with the devices. The impulse response also revealed the existence of long-delayed multipaths up to 132 m propagation distance in a reverberant 30-m-long corridor."}

However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems."}

Although unified resource allocation (URA) can mitigate these issues, it remains unclear whether NA can be sustained under such diverse conditions. To address this, we derive expressions for the lower bound (LB) on NA in AHetNets under URA. Our analysis reveals that extended heterogeneity significantly degrades the LB due to resource limitations-even when the heterogeneity stems from additional services under less stringent delay constraints (LSDC) or from UEs with lower mobility. To overcome this degradation, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem for the number of UEs sharing time-frequency resources ($K$) and pilot length ($ξ$), aiming to enhance the LB by improving spatial, frequency, and temporal resource efficiency.

In this paper, we derive the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigate how the array geometry influences near-field beamdepth and its limits. We define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), to present a near-field boundary with respect to beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains for the generalized URA. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed element count constraint, the array geometry has a strong impact on beamdepth, whereas this effect diminishes under a fixed aperture length constraint. Moreover, compared to uniform square arrays, elongated configurations such as uniform linear arrays (ULAs) yield narrower beamdepth and extend the effective near-field region defined by the EBRD. Building on these insights, we design a polar codebook for compressed-sensing-based channel estimation that leverages our findings. Simulation results show that the proposed polar codebook achieves a 2 dB NMSE improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present an analytical expression to quantify the effective spatial DoF in the near-field, revealing that they are also constrained by the EBRD. Notably, the maximum spatial DoF is achieved with a ULA configuration, outperforming a square URA in this regard."}

Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms."}
