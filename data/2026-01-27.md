TL;DR: SPUR-iG：一种用于3D磁共振指纹成像的深度展开重建框架，结合隐式GROG数据一致性和渐进式训练策略，在保持高分辨率的同时显著提升重建速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D MRF重建计算量大，非笛卡尔重建需要重复的非均匀FFT，局部低秩先验在高加速下效果不足且计算开销大。学习型3D先验虽然能解决这些问题，但由于内存和运行时需求，大规模训练具有挑战性。

Method: 提出SPUR-iG框架：1）数据一致性使用隐式GROG，将非笛卡尔数据网格化到笛卡尔网格，实现基于FFT的高效更新；2）采用三阶段渐进训练策略：预训练去噪器、贪婪逐次展开训练、梯度检查点微调。

Result: 在1mm各向同性分辨率的大规模体内数据集上，SPUR-iG相比LLR和混合2D/3D展开基线，提升了子空间系数图质量和定量准确性。全脑重建在15秒内完成，对2分钟采集有111倍加速。30秒扫描的T1图准确性达到或超过2分钟扫描的LLR重建。

Conclusion: SPUR-iG框架通过隐式GROG和渐进训练策略，实现了大规模3D MRF重建在准确性和速度上的双重提升，为高效可靠的加速定量成像提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging, yet reconstructing high-resolution 3D data remains computationally demanding. Non-Cartesian reconstructions require repeated non-uniform FFTs, and the commonly used Locally Low Rank (LLR) prior adds computational overhead and becomes insufficient at high accelerations. Learned 3D priors could address these limitations, but training them at scale is challenging due to memory and runtime demands. We propose SPUR-iG, a fully 3D deep unrolled subspace reconstruction framework that integrates efficient data consistency with a progressive training strategy. Data consistency leverages implicit GROG, which grids non-Cartesian data onto a Cartesian grid with an implicitly learned kernel, enabling FFT-based updates with minimal artifacts. Training proceeds in three stages: (1) pretraining a denoiser with extensive data augmentation, (2) greedy per-iteration unrolled training, and (3) final fine-tuning with gradient checkpointing. Together, these stages make large-scale 3D unrolled learning feasible within a reasonable compute budget. On a large in vivo dataset with retrospective undersampling, SPUR-iG improves subspace coefficient maps quality and quantitative accuracy at 1-mm isotropic resolution compared with LLR and a hybrid 2D/3D unrolled baseline. Whole-brain reconstructions complete in under 15-seconds, with up to $\times$111 speedup for 2-minute acquisitions. Notably, $T_1$ maps with our method from 30-second scans achieve accuracy on par with or exceeding LLR reconstructions from 2-minute scans. Overall, the framework improves both accuracy and speed in large-scale 3D MRF reconstruction, enabling efficient and reliable accelerated quantitative imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出EGAD主动学习采样器用于胎儿超声头部分割，结合熵引导和一致性-多样性评分，在有限标注数据下提升半监督学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿超声数据因隐私和监管限制而稀缺，现有半监督学习方法采用随机有限选择，容易对同质标注数据过拟合，导致模型性能不佳。

Method: 提出两阶段主动学习采样器EGAD：第一阶段用预测熵选择最不确定样本；第二阶段用余弦相似度和互信息结合的一致性-多样性评分进行最终选择。半监督学习框架采用特征下采样的一致性学习策略。

Result: 在两个公开胎儿头部分割数据集上，使用5%和10%标注数据分别达到94.57%和96.32%的平均Dice分数，优于现有半监督学习方法，在不同孕期数据上表现稳健。

Conclusion: EGAD采样器能有效选择信息丰富的样本，提升有限标注数据下的胎儿超声分割性能，为医学图像分析中的半监督学习提供了新方法。

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound (US) data is often limited due to privacy and regulatory restrictions, posing challenges for training deep learning (DL) models. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) is commonly used for fetal US image analysis, existing SSL methods typically rely on random limited selection, which can lead to suboptimal model performance by overfitting to homogeneous labeled data. To address this, we propose a two-stage Active Learning (AL) sampler, Entropy-Guided Agreement-Diversity (EGAD), for fetal head segmentation. Our method first selects the most uncertain samples using predictive entropy, and then refines the final selection using the agreement-diversity score combining cosine similarity and mutual information. Additionally, our SSL framework employs a consistency learning strategy with feature downsampling to further enhance segmentation performance. In experiments, SSL-EGAD achieves an average Dice score of 94.57\% and 96.32\% on two public datasets for fetal head segmentation, using 5\% and 10\% labeled data for training, respectively. Our method outperforms current SSL models and showcases consistent robustness across diverse pregnancy stage data.

*Ravi Venkata Surya Sai Mogilisetti,Partha Pratim Das,Rassel Raihan,Shiyao Lin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型数字图像相关(DIC)分析范式——原位按需DIC(ISOD DIC)，通过将相机控制集成到DIC流程中，根据变形程度动态调整成像帧率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DIC方法在实验力学中应用广泛，但存在固定帧率导致的数据冗余或关键变形信息缺失问题。需要一种能根据变形情况智能调整成像频率的方法，以提高数据丰富度同时减少存储和分析负担

Method: 开发了ISOD DIC新范式，将相机控制集成到DIC处理流程中。核心思想是根据变形程度和变形速率动态调整相机成像帧率：在变形小且慢时保持较低帧率，在变形过大或变形速率高时动态提高帧率

Result: ISOD DIC实现了实时变形分析、可视化和闭环相机控制。在裂纹扩展实验中，相比传统DIC多捕获了约178%的图像，显著提高了损伤检测的数据丰富度，同时避免了过度消耗存储空间和分析时间

Conclusion: ISOD DIC通过动态调整成像帧率的新范式，有效平衡了数据丰富度和资源消耗，为材料本构行为和损伤机制的表征提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Digital image correlation (DIC) has become one of the most popular methods for deformation characterization in experimental mechanics. DIC is based on optical images taken during experimentation and post-test image processing. Its advantages include the capability to capture full-field deformation in a non-contact manner, the robustness in characterizing excessive deformation induced by events such as yielding and cracking, and the versatility to integrate optical cameras with a variety of open-source and commercial codes. In this paper, we developed a new paradigm of DIC analysis by integrating camera control into the DIC process flow. The essential idea is to dynamically increase the camera imaging frame rate with excessive deformation or deformation rate, while maintaining a relatively low imaging frame rate with small and slow deformation. We refer to this new DIC paradigm as in-situ on-demand (ISOD) DIC. ISOD DIC enables real-time deformation analysis, visualization, and closed-loop camera control. ISOD DIC has captured approximately 178% more images than conventional DIC for samples undergoing crack growth due to its dynamically adjusted frame rate, with the potential to significantly enhance data richness for damage inspection without consuming excessive storage space and analysis time, thereby benefiting the characterization of intrinsic constitutive behaviors and damage mechanisms

### [4] [Fast Multirate Encoding for 360° Video in OMAF Streaming Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17568)
*Amritha Premkumar,Christian Herglotz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文研究360度视频的多码率编码加速策略，通过跨QP和分辨率重用编码器分析信息，显著减少8K 360度视频的编码时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 8K 360度视频的多码率编码计算量巨大，需要为自适应流媒体生成多种分辨率和QP的表示，传统编码方法效率低下。

Method: 提出两种跨分辨率信息重用流水线：1) 严格的HD->4K->8K级联缩放分析重用；2) 分辨率锚定方案，每个分辨率先用自己的最高码率参考编码，再指导依赖编码。同时将这两种方法应用于立方体贴图投影分块编码。

Result: 实验使用SJTU 8K 360度数据集，分层分析重用显著加速HEVC编码，ERP内容编码时间减少33%-59%，CMP平均减少51%，BDET增益接近-50%，实际速度提升最高达4.2倍。

Conclusion: 提出的多码率分析重用策略能有效加速8K 360度视频编码，在保持率失真性能的同时大幅减少编码时间，适用于ERP和CMP两种投影格式。

Abstract: Preparing high-quality 360-degree video for HTTP Adaptive Streaming requires encoding each sequence into multiple representations spanning different resolutions and quantization parameters (QPs). For ultra-high-resolution immersive content such as 8K 360-degree video, this process is computationally intensive due to the large number of representations and the high complexity of modern codecs. This paper investigates fast multirate encoding strategies that reduce encoding time by reusing encoder analysis information across QPs and resolutions. We evaluate two cross-resolution information-reuse pipelines that differ in how reference encodes propagate across resolutions: (i) a strict HD -> 4K -> 8K cascade with scaled analysis reuse, and (ii) a resolution-anchored scheme that initializes each resolution with its own highest-bitrate reference before guiding dependent encodes. In addition to evaluating these pipelines on standard equirectangular projection content, we also apply the same two pipelines to cubemap-projection (CMP) tiling, where each 360-degree frame is partitioned into independently encoded tiles. CMP introduces substantial parallelism, while still benefiting from the proposed multirate analysis-reuse strategies. Experimental results using the SJTU 8K 360-degree dataset show that hierarchical analysis reuse significantly accelerates HEVC encoding with minimal rate-distortion impact across both equirectangular and CMP-tiled content, yielding encoding-time reductions of roughly 33%-59% for ERP and about 51% on average for CMP, with Bjontegaard Delta Encoding Time (BDET) gains approaching -50% and wall-clock speedups of up to 4.2x.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 开发了一种胶囊大小的多波长光学传感无线平台，用于对胃肠道出血流速进行数量级分类，准确率达98.75%，能耗降低88%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内镜治疗后72小时内胃肠道再出血是早期发病和死亡的主要原因。现有非侵入性监测方法主要提供二元血液检测，缺乏对出血严重程度或血流动力学的定量评估，限制了在高风险时期及时临床决策的能力。

Method: 开发了胶囊大小的多波长光学传感无线平台，利用透射光谱和低功耗边缘人工智能。系统进行时间分辨的多光谱测量，并采用轻量级二维卷积神经网络进行设备端流速分类，通过基于物理的验证确认与波长依赖性血红蛋白吸收行为的一致性。

Result: 在模拟胃环境的受控体外实验中，该方法在多个出血流速水平上实现了98.75%的整体分类准确率，同时能稳健地区分各种非血液胃肠道干扰。通过直接在胶囊电子设备上进行嵌入式推理，与连续无线传输原始数据相比，系统总能耗降低了约88%。

Conclusion: 该平台将胶囊诊断从二元血液检测扩展到连续、特定部位的出血严重程度评估，有潜力支持早期识别临床显著再出血，并在内镜后监测期间为及时再干预提供信息。

Abstract: Post-endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) rebleeding frequently occurs within the first 72 hours after therapeutic hemostasis and remains a major cause of early morbidity and mortality. Existing non-invasive monitoring approaches primarily provide binary blood detection and lack quantitative assessment of bleeding severity or flow dynamic, limiting their ability to support timely clinical decision-making during this high-risk period. In this work, we developed a capsule-sized, multi-wavelength optical sensing wireless platform for order-of-magnitude-level classification of GI bleeding flow rate, leveraging transmission spectroscopy and low-power edge artificial intelligence. The system performs time-resolved, multi-spectral measurements and employs a lightweight two-dimensional convolutional neural network for on-device flow-rate classification, with physics-based validation confirming consistency with wavelength-dependent hemoglobin absorption behavior. In controlled in vitro experiments under simulated gastric conditions, the proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.75% across multiple bleeding flow-rate levels while robustly distinguishing diverse non-blood gastrointestinal interference. By performing embedded inference directly on the capsule electronics, the system reduced overall energy consumption by approximately 88% compared with continuous wireless transmission of raw data, making prolonged, battery-powered operation feasible. Extending capsule-based diagnostics beyond binary blood detection toward continuous, site-specific assessment of bleeding severity, this platform has the potential to support earlier identification of clinically significant rebleeding and inform timely re-intervention during post-endoscopic surveillance.

### [6] [Dominant Sets Based Band Selection in Hyperspectral Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18034)
*Onur Haliloğlu,Ufuk Sakarya,B. Uğur Töreyin,Orhan Gazi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出基于"主导集"的波段选择框架，通过聚类选择最具代表性的波段，减少高光谱数据量并提高分类精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像数据量大导致传输延迟和处理困难，且训练样本不足时会出现休斯现象，需要通过特征选择解决大数据问题

Method: 基于"主导集"的波段选择框架：将光谱波段聚类，从每个簇中选择最能代表簇行为的波段，形成特定应用最有价值的波段集合

Result: 在Pavia和Salinas数据集上的实验表明，该框架在分类精度上优于现有最先进的特征选择方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在不处理整个数据集的情况下确定分类所需的波段，计算复杂度低，性能优于现有方法

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagery is composed of huge amount of data which creates significant transmission latencies for communication systems. It is vital to decrease the huge data size before transmitting the Hyperspectral imagery. Besides, large data size leads to processing problems, especially in practical applications. Moreover, due to the lack of sufficient training samples, Hughes phenomena occur with huge amount of data. Feature selection can be used in order to get rid of huge data problems. In this paper, a band selection framework is introduced to reduce the data size and to find out the most proper spectral bands for a specific application. The method is based on finding "dominant sets" in hyperspectral data, so that spectral bands are clustered. From each cluster, the band that reflects the cluster behavior the most is selected to form the most valuable band set in the spectra for a specific application. The proposed feature selection method has low computational complexity since it performs on a small size of data when realizing the feature selection. The aim of the study is to find out a general framework that can define required bands for classification without requiring to perform on the whole data set. Results on Pavia and Salinas datasets show that the proposed framework performs better than the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of classification accuracy.

### [7] [High-Rate Quantized Matrix Multiplication: Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17187)
*Or Ordentlich,Yury Polyanskiy*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了量化矩阵乘法问题，分析了通用矩阵乘法和仅权重量化两种设置，提出了基于水填充原理的WaterSIC量化方案，在信息论极限方面取得了接近最优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛部署，量化矩阵乘法对于高效推理变得至关重要。论文旨在理解不同量化方案与信息论极限之间的差距，并改进现有量化算法的性能。

Method: 论文首先回顾了量化率与失真之间的信息论基本权衡，然后分析了多种流行量化方案（absmax INT、FP量化）的性能。针对仅权重量化问题，提出了基于加权均方误差源编码的WaterSIC方案，利用水填充原理优化率分配。

Result: WaterSIC方案仅使用标量INT量化器，其高频性能仅取决于协方差矩阵的行列式，对随机旋转具有不变性，且距离信息论失真极限仅差乘性因子2πe/12（约0.25比特/条目）。GPTQ在随机旋转下与WaterSIC性能接近（相差约0.1比特）。

Conclusion: 论文为量化矩阵乘法建立了理论框架，提出的WaterSIC方案在信息论意义上接近最优，同时揭示了现有GPTQ算法在随机旋转下也能达到接近最优的性能，为实际LLM量化部署提供了理论指导。

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $Σ_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $Σ_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\frac{2πe}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $Σ_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).

TL;DR: 优化大规模MU-MIMO系统中有限容量前传链路的比特分配，在CSI量化和预编码矩阵量化之间进行比特分配以最大化总频谱效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集中式基带单元控制的高级天线系统中，前传链路容量有限，需要在CSI量化和预编码矩阵量化之间合理分配比特资源，这是一个关键挑战

Method: 基于硬化边界推导频谱效率表达式，对最大比传输获得闭式解，然后制定比特分割优化问题并提出精确求解算法

Abstract: This paper optimizes the fronthaul bit allocation in massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems operating with limited-capacity fronthaul links. We consider an advanced antenna system (AAS) controlled by a centralized baseband unit (BBU). In the AAS, multiple antenna elements together with their radio units are integrated into a single unit. In this setup, a key challenge is allocating fronthaul bits between uplink channel state information (CSI) quantization and downlink precoding matrix quantization. We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it.
  Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了非负矩阵的永久值与Bethe永久值的比率，针对块结构矩阵进行了数值分析，发现该比率强烈集中在仅依赖于少数关键参数的值附近，并使用图覆盖方法解释这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然矩阵永久值与Bethe永久值的比率在最坏情况下上下界相差指数级，但在实际应用中观察到该比率对许多矩阵集合都强烈集中在某个仅依赖于矩阵大小的值附近。本文旨在研究块结构矩阵集合中这一现象的原因和量化方法。

Method: 1. 对块结构矩阵（块内元素取值相同）的永久值与Bethe永久值比率进行数值研究；2. 使用图覆盖方法解释观察到的行为；3. 量化观察到的比率值。

Result: 对于块结构矩阵集合，永久值与Bethe永久值的比率同样强烈集中在仅依赖于集合中少数关键参数的值附近。图覆盖方法能够解释这一行为并量化观察到的值。

Conclusion: 块结构矩阵的永久值与Bethe永久值比率表现出强烈的集中现象，这一行为可以通过图覆盖方法得到解释和量化，为理解Bethe永久值作为矩阵永久值近似工具的实际性能提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We consider the permanent of a square matrix with non-negative entries. A tractable approximation is given by the so-called Bethe permanent that can be efficiently computed by running the sum-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph. While the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent is, in the worst case, upper and lower bounded by expressions that are exponentially far apart in the matrix size, in practice it is observed for many ensembles of matrices of interest that this ratio is strongly concentrated around some value that depends only on the matrix size. In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble. We use graph-cover-based approaches to explain the reasons for this behavior and to quantify the observed value.

Abstract: In cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, robust resource allocation is critical to ensure reliable system performance in the presence of channel uncertainties resulting from imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this work, we propose a robust power allocation method that formulates the power optimization problem into a least-squares framework, enhanced by Tikhonov regularization to mitigate the adverse effects of channel estimation errors. We integrate our approach with zero-forcing precoding, enabling a design that is both computationally efficient and resilient to CSI imperfections. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing non-robust techniques while benefiting from low computational overhead, making it well-suited for large-scale deployments under CSI uncertainty.

### [11] [A Model-Driven Lossless Compression Algorithm Resistant to Mismatch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17684)
*Cordelia Hu,Jennifer Tang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种基于下一标记预测的鲁棒压缩算法，能够容忍结构化预测不匹配，在认证的不匹配范围内可靠运行，压缩比优于常用压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预测模型（如大语言模型）与熵编码结合可以实现优于标准压缩算法的压缩率，但这种方法依赖于编码器和解码器产生相同输出分布的假设。然而，对于基于神经网络的复杂预测模型，即使小的不匹配也会导致解码失败，这种现象被称为非确定性。

Method: 提出一种基于下一标记预测的新压缩算法，该算法对任意大但结构化的预测不匹配具有鲁棒性。在正式的不匹配认证下证明方案的正确性，并理论分析其性能。

Result: 在真实数据集上进行实验验证，结果表明在认证的不匹配范围内能够可靠运行，同时实现的压缩比超过了常用压缩方法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法解决了预测模型在编码器和解码器之间不匹配的问题，为基于预测模型的压缩提供了鲁棒性解决方案，在实际应用中具有优势。

Abstract: Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail. This assumption often fails with complex predictive models, particularly those based on neural networks, a phenomenon referred to as non-determinism.
  In this work, we propose a new compression algorithm based on next-token prediction that is robust to arbitrarily large, but structured, prediction mismatches. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme under a formal mismatch certification, characterize its theoretical performance, and validate it experimentally on real datasets. Our results demonstrate reliable operation within the certified mismatch regime while achieving compression ratios that exceed those of commonly used compression methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G系统向全频谱覆盖、超宽带和高移动性演进，传播环境日益复杂。现有信道探测设备缺乏跨频段能力、在动态场景中表现不佳且环境感知有限，阻碍了环境感知信道模型的发展。

Abstract: 6G system is evolving toward full-spectrum coverage,ultra-wide bandwidth, and high mobility, resulting in increasingly complex propagation environments. The deep integration of communication and sensing is widely recognized as a core 6G vision, underscoring the importance of comprehensive environment awareness. Accurate channel modeling forms the foundation of 6G system design and optimization, and channel sounders provide the essential empirical basis. However, existing channel sounders, although supporting wide bandwidth and large antenna arrays in selected bands, generally lack cross-band capability, struggle in dynamic scenarios, and provide limited environmental awareness. The absence of detailed environmental information restricts the development of environment-aware channel models. To address this gap, we propose a multi-modal sensing and channel sounding fusion platform that enables temporally and spatially synchronized acquisition of images, point clouds, geolocation information, and multi-band multi-antenna channel data. The modular architecture facilitates rapid deployment in diverse dynamic environments. The platform supports Sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands with up to 1 GHz bandwidth and 1 ns delay resolution, enabling multi-antenna measurements with a channel switching rate of 8 ms. Moreover, it achieves centimeter-level and 360° environmental sensing accuracy and meter-level positioning accuracy. Key performance metrics of the platform, including dynamic range, phase stability, delay resolution, and multimodal data synchronization, are validated through vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaign. The established platform supports environment-channel joint modeling, enabling analysis and optimization of channel models in dynamic 6G scenarios.

Result: 扩展操作成功将OPP编码扩展到GP情况，在某些参数下优于现有方法。新提出的GP方案不遵循某些组合约束，在一系列参数范围内表现优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过扩展操作可以将OPP编码扩展到GP情况，改进现有PDMM编码的性能。同时发现某些组合约束可能限制性能，提出不遵循这些约束的新GP方案能够获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: We consider polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM). Existing codes for PDMM are either specialized for the outer product partitioning (OPP), or inner product partitioning (IPP), or are valid for the more general grid partitioning (GP). We design extension operations that can be applied to a large class of OPP code designs to extend them to the GP case. Applying them to existing codes improves upon the state-of-the-art for certain parameters. Additionally, we show that the GP schemes resulting from extension fulfill additional combinatorial constraints, potentially limiting their performance. We illustrate this point by presenting a new GP scheme that does not adhere to these constraints and outperforms the state-of-the-art for a range of parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rydberg原子接收机MIMO系统由于非线性信号模型面临信号检测的可扩展性挑战，需要一种能够实现有效线性信号模型同时保持频谱效率的方法

Method: 提出相位旋转符号扩展(PRSS)方法，在每个符号的两个连续传输时隙中引入最优π/2相位偏移，从而重构有效的线性信号模型，使传统RF-MIMO检测算法得以应用

Result: 仿真结果显示，与当前单次传输方法相比，PRSS在使用最优穷举搜索和低复杂度次优检测方法时，分别实现了超过2.5dB和10dB的误码率改善

Conclusion: PRSS方法成功解决了Rydberg原子接收机MIMO系统的非线性信号检测问题，实现了有效的线性信号模型重构，显著提升了系统性能，同时保持了频谱效率

Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers face significant scalability challenges in signal detection due to their nonlinear signal models. This letter proposes phase-rotated symbol spreading (PRSS), which transmits each symbol across two consecutive time slots with an optimal π/2 phase offset. PRSS enables reconstruction of an effective linear signal model while maintaining spectral efficiency and facilitating the use of conventional RF-MIMO detection algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that PRSS achieves greater than 2.5 dB and 10 dB bit error rate improvements compared to current single-transmission methods when employing optimal exhaustive search and low-complexity sub-optimal detection methods, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化安全聚合（DSA）问题，在去中心化联邦学习和随机优化中，多个用户希望安全计算输入总和而不泄露各自输入，建立了最优速率区域的理论界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着去中心化联邦学习（FL）和随机优化中对数据安全需求的增加，需要解决在去中心化环境下安全聚合私有数据的问题，确保即使有用户合谋也无法获取超出总和的额外信息。

Method: 通过信息论方法研究去中心化安全聚合问题，考虑K个互连用户网络，每个用户持有私有输入（如FL中的本地模型更新），目标是同时计算所有输入的总和，同时满足安全要求。

Result: 刻画了最优速率区域，确定了DSA的最小可达通信速率和密钥速率。具体证明：为安全计算输入总和的一个比特，每个用户必须（i）向所有其他用户传输至少一个比特，（ii）持有至少一个比特的密钥，（iii）所有用户集体必须持有不少于K-1个独立密钥比特。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了去中心化安全聚合的基本性能极限，为设计可证明安全且通信高效的分布式学习系统协议提供了理论指导和设计洞见。

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing demand for data security in decentralized federated learning (FL) and stochastic optimization, we formulate and investigate the problem of information-theoretic \emph{decentralized secure aggregation} (DSA). Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ interconnected users, each holding a private input, representing, for example, local model updates in FL, who aim to simultaneously compute the sum of all inputs while satisfying the security requirement that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ others, learns anything beyond the intended sum. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one bit of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one bit to all other users, (ii) hold at least one bit of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key bits. Our result establishes the fundamental performance limits of DSA and offers insights into the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols for distributed learning systems.

Abstract: In the paper, the physical-layer security for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is studied. There is an active eavesdropper (AE) as well as a passive eavesdropper (PE), and they cooperate each other. By joint base station beamforming and RIS reflection design, we aim to achieve the best secure data communications with guaranteed sensing performance. Mathematically, taking the constraints on sensing performance and transmission power in consideration, the system secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated with respect to transmitting beamforming, RIS reflection, and receiving beamforming. The formulated problem is non-convex and is decomposed to three subproblem by applying the alternating optimization scheme. For the decomposed subproblem, we utilize the quadratic penalty method and successive convex approximation (SCA) for the solution derivation. Thereafter, an iterative numerical algorithm, referred to as the joint beamforming and reflection design (JBRD) algorithm, is proposed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PASS-enabled FL通过可调天线重新配置上行延迟，联合优化天线放置和客户端参与，最小化达到目标精度的时间，在延迟-统计异质性权衡中实现更优的时钟效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步无线联邦学习中，慢客户端（straggler）的同步是主要的时钟瓶颈。但在非IID数据下，仅采样快速客户端会因统计异质性显著减慢收敛速度。需要平衡延迟和统计异质性。

Method: 提出PASS-enabled FL框架，使用可调辐射夹持天线（PA）在介质波导上任意位置激活以重塑上行延迟。联合优化PA放置和客户端参与，通过顺序统计量精确建模最大轮延迟，结合异质性感知收敛因子，最小化期望达到目标精度的时间。

Conclusion: PASS通过可调天线重新配置延迟，使更多符合条件的客户端能够参与，在延迟-统计异质性权衡中实现更高的时钟精度，为同步无线联邦学习提供了有效的延迟管理方案。

Abstract: Straggler synchronization is a dominant wall-clock bottleneck in synchronous wireless federated learning (FL). Under non-IID data, however, aggressively sampling only fast clients may significantly slow convergence due to statistical heterogeneity. This paper studies PASS-enabled FL, where a radiating pinching antenna (PA) can be activated at an arbitrary position along a dielectric waveguide to reshape uplink latencies. We consider a joint optimization of PA placement and client participation to minimize the expected time-to-accuracy, coupling the exact expected maximum round latency via order statistics with a heterogeneity-aware convergence factor. We derive first-order optimality conditions that reveal an explicit tail-latency premium in the KKT recursion, quantifying how latency gaps are amplified by maximum-order-statistic synchronization. Under a latency-class structure, we obtain a within-class square-root sampling law and establish a two-class phase transition where slow-class participation collapses under an explicit heterogeneity-threshold condition as the per-round sample size grows. For PA placement, we prove a piecewise envelope-derivative characterization and provide an exact breakpoint-and-root candidate-enumeration procedure. Simulation results verify the theoretical findings and show that PASS enables more eligible participation, yielding higher wall-clock accuracy.

Motivation: 传统GNN在无线资源管理中面临大规模密集网络的计算挑战，量子计算与GNN结合可提升计算效率，但现有纯量子消息传递模型受限于量子比特数量，可扩展性不足。

Method: 提出可扩展量子消息传递图神经网络(SQM-GNN)，将图分解为子图，对每个局部子图应用共享参数化量子电路(PQC)，同时结合节点和边特征以完整表示无线图结构。

Conclusion: SQM-GNN为未来无线网络优化提供了有前景的方向，通过量子计算增强GNN的可扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are eminently suitable for wireless resource management, thanks to their scalability, but they still face computational challenges in large-scale, dense networks in classical computers. The integration of quantum computing with GNNs offers a promising pathway for enhancing computational efficiency because they reduce the model complexity. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum advantages of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), while retaining the expressive power of GNNs. However, existing pure quantum message passing models remain constrained by the limited number of qubits, hence limiting the scalability of their application to the wireless systems. As a remedy, we conceive a Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Network (SQM-GNN) relying on a quantum message passing architecture. To address the aforementioned scalability issue, we decompose the graph into subgraphs and apply a shared PQC to each local subgraph. Importantly, the model incorporates both node and edge features, facilitating the full representation of the underlying wireless graph structure. We demonstrate the efficiency of SQM GNN on a device-to-device (D2D) power control task, where it outperforms both classical GNNs and heuristic baselines. These results highlight SQM-GNN as a promising direction for future wireless network optimization.

Abstract: Approximating the permanent of a complex-valued matrix is a fundamental problem with applications in Boson sampling and probabilistic inference. In this paper, we extend factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of non-negative-real-valued matrices that are based on running the sum-product algorithm (SPA) on standard normal factor graphs, to factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of complex-valued matrices that are based on running the SPA on double-edge normal factor graphs.
  On the algorithmic side, we investigate the behavior of the SPA, in particular how the SPA fixed points change when transitioning from real-valued to complex-valued matrix ensembles. On the analytical side, we use graph covers to analyze the Bethe approximation of the permanent, i.e., the approximation of the permanent that is obtained with the help of the SPA.
  This combined algorithmic and analytical perspective provides new insight into the structure of Bethe approximations in complex-valued problems and clarifies when such approximations remain meaningful beyond the non-negative-real-valued settings.

Abstract: Traditional cellular networks struggle with poor quality of service (QoS) for cell-edge users, while cell-free (CF) systems offer uniform QoS but incur high roll-out costs due to acquiring numerous access point (AP) sites and deploying a large-scale optical fiber network to connect them. This paper proposes a cost-effective heterogeneous massive MIMO architecture that integrates centralized co-located antennas at a cell-center base station with distributed edge APs. By strategically splitting massive antennas between centralized and distributed nodes, the system maintains high user fairness comparable to CF systems but reduces infrastructure costs substantially, by minimizing the required number of AP sites and fronthaul connections. Numerical results demonstrate its superiority in balancing performance and costs compared to cellular and CF systems.

Abstract: Cooperation between satellite and terrestrial wireless networks promises great potential in meeting fast-growing demands for ubiquitous communications coverage. To tackle spectrum scarcity, spectrum sharing is studied for a hybrid satellite-terrestrial network where satellite links share the same group of time-slotted sub-carriers with terrestrial links opportunistically. In particular, with coarse network-wide time synchronization, a time-scale-adaptable spectrum sharing framework is proposed based on a satellite-terrestrial cooperation time scale that can be flexibly adjusted according to practical requirements. For generality, it is assumed that both full and partial frequency reuse could be adopted among the base stations (BSs) and satellite selection is supported when multiple satellites are available. Relying on only statistical channel state information (CSI), joint link scheduling and power control are explored to maximize the average sum rate of the network while ensuring quality of service (QoS) for users. To solve the complicated mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, a low-complexity spectrum sharing scheme is presented based on link-feature-sketching-aided hierarchical link clustering and Monte-Carlo-and-successive-approximation-aided transmit power optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that by link feature sketching, diversity of the links brought by the spatial distribution of the users could be well utilized. The proposed scheme promises a significant performance gain even under strict inter-link interference constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然高传输速率通常需要较大的消息大小，但较小的消息大小由于实现复杂度低和约束少而更受青睐。现有研究在无合谋模式下已证明最优消息大小为N-1，但在更一般的合谋模式下尚未有可比结果。

Abstract: A private information retrieval protocol (PIR) scheme under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$ enables a client to retrieve one message from a library of $K$ equal-sized messages duplicated in $N$ servers, while keeping the index of the desired message private from any colluding set in $\mathcal{P}$. Although achieving high rates typically requires sufficiently large message sizes, smaller message sizes also desirable due to reduced implementation complexity and fewer constraints. By characterizing the capacity-achieving schemes, Tian, Sun, and Chen (2019) showed that the optimal message size for uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under no-collusion setting is $N-1$. However, comparable results are not yet available for more general collusion settings.
  In this work, we present a complete characterization of the properties of capacity-achieving decomposable PIR schemes under arbitrary collusion patterns. Building on this characterization, we derive a general lower bound on the optimal message size for capacity-achieving uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$, expressed in terms of the hitting number of a newly defined family of subsets of servers determined by the collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$. Finally, we specialize the lower bound to several important classes of collusion patterns, including $T$-collusion, disjoint collections of colluding sets, cyclically $T$-contiguous collusion, and disjoint collections of cyclically contiguous colluding sets. For the last two collusion patterns, we present matching achievable schemes that attain the corresponding bounds, thereby providing a complete characterization of the optimal message size.

Conclusion: 本文在多子串编辑的文档交换问题上取得了重要进展，既降低了计算复杂度，又改进了编码长度，特别是在均匀字符串情况下实现了更优的期望编码性能。

Abstract: We study the document exchange problem under multiple substring edits. A substring edit in a string $\mathbf{x}$ occurs when a substring $\mathbf{u}$ of $\mathbf{x}$ is replaced by an arbitrary string $\mathbf{v}$. The lengths of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are bounded from above by a fixed constant. Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be two binary strings that differ by multiple substring edits. The aim of document exchange schemes is to construct an encoding of $\mathbf{x}$ with small length such that $\mathbf{x}$ can be recovered using $\mathbf{y}$ and the encoding. We construct a low-complexity document exchange scheme with encoding length of $4t\log n+o(\log n)$ bits, where $n$ is the length of the string $\mathbf{x}$. The best known scheme achieves an encoding length of $4t \log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits, but at a much higher computational complexity. Then, we investigate the average length of valid encodings for document exchange schemes with uniform strings $\mathbf{x}$ and develop a scheme with an expected encoding length of $(4t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits. In this setting, prior works have only constructed schemes for a single substring edit.

Abstract: Finite-aperture constraints render array design nontrivial and can undermine the effectiveness of classical sparse geometries. This letter provides universal guidance for fluid antenna array (FAA) design under a fixed aperture. We derive a closed-form Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) that unifies conventional and reconfigurable arrays by explicitly linking the Fisher information to the geometric variance of port locations. We further obtain a closed-form probability density function of the minimum spacing under random FAA placement, which yields a principled lower bound for the minimum-spacing constraint. Building upon these analytical insights, we then propose a gradient-based algorithm to optimize continuous port locations. Utilizing a simple gradient update design, the optimized FAA can achieve about a $30\%$ CRB reduction and a $42.5\%$ reduction in mean-squared error.

Abstract: We study the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $Φ$-ribbon for joint distributions that obey a given independence structure, obtaining tight bounds in some basic regimes. For general independence structures, modeled as a hypergraph whose hyperedges specify mutually independent subcollections of random variables, we provide an explicit inner bound on the $Φ$-ribbon described by a simple convex hull of incidence vectors. We also provide a new multipartite generalization version and a $Φ$-mutual information analogue of the Zhang--Yeung inequality, which implies nontrivial points in the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $Φ$-ribbon respectively. Finally, we propose the matrix $Φ$-ribbon based on matrix $Φ$-entropy and establish the tensorization and data processing properties, together with the calculation of an exact matrix SDPI constant for the doubly symmetric binary source.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简洁的概率方法，改进了经典Gilbert-Varshamov(GV)界和量子GV界，分别获得了√n倍的改进因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GV界是编码理论中的核心基准，但几十年来改进GV界非常困难，现有改进通常依赖技术性强的论证，且由于额外的自正交约束难以自然扩展到量子设置。

Method: 开发了一种简洁的概率方法，通过分析q元线性码的存在条件，并进一步适应量子设置，分析辛自正交结构。

Result: 对于经典线性码，当相对距离δ<1-1/q时，存在性条件比传统GV界更宽松；对于量子码，当δ<1-1/q²时，获得了比标准量子GV界改进Ω(√n)倍的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法简洁有效，同时改进了经典和量子GV界，为编码理论提供了新的存在性保证。

Abstract: The Gilbert--Varshamov (GV) bound is a central benchmark in coding theory, establishing existential guarantees for error-correcting codes and serving as a baseline for both Hamming and quantum fault-tolerant information processing. Despite decades of effort, improving the GV bound is notoriously difficult, and known improvements often rely on technically heavy arguments and do not extend naturally to the quantum setting due to additional self-orthogonality constraints.
  In this work we develop a concise probabilistic method that yields an improvement over the classical GV bound for $q$-ary linear codes. For relative distance $δ=d/n<1-1/q$, we show that an $[n,k,d]_q$ linear code exists whenever $\frac{q^{k}-1}{q-1}\;<\;\frac{c_δ\sqrt{n}\, q^{n}}{\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)}$, for positive constant $c_δ$ depending only on $δ$, where $\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)$ denotes the volume of a $q$-ary Hamming ball.
  We further adapt this approach to the quantum setting by analyzing symplectic self-orthogonal structures. For $δ<1-1/q^2$, we obtain an improved quantum GV bound: there exists a $q$-ary quantum code $[[n,\,n-k,\,d]]$ provided that $\frac{q^{2n-k}-1}{q-1}<\frac{c_δ\sqrt{n}\cdot q^{2n}}{\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\binom{n}{i}(q^2-1)^i}$. In particular, our result improves the standard quantum GV bound by an $Ω(\sqrt{n})$ multiplicative factor.

Result: 推导了符号错误率性能的解析表达式及分集增益和编码增益的渐近结果，获得了最优旋转角度和位移与压缩之间能量分配的闭式解，当位移幅度和压缩强度随总光子数缩放时，有效分集阶数可达4。

Conclusion: 量子旋转分集方案在Gamma-Gamma湍流信道中表现出超分集行为，通过优化设计可显著提高光学量子通信系统的性能。

Abstract: We propose a quantum rotation diversity (QRD) scheme for optical quantum communication using binary phase-shift-keying displaced squeezed states and homodyne detection over Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels. Consecutive temporal modes are coupled by a passive orthogonal rotation that redistributes the displacement amplitude between slots, yielding a diversity order of two under independent fading and joint maximum-likelihood detection. Analytical expressions for the symbol-error rate performance, along with asymptotic results for the diversity and coding gains, are derived. The optimal rotation angle and energy allocation between displacement and squeezing are obtained in closed form. Furthermore, we show that when both the displacement amplitude and the squeezing strength scale with the total photon number, an effective diversity order of four is achieved. Numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate the super-diversity behaviour of the proposed QRD scheme.

Motivation: 在不可信分布式计算环境中，评估索引的分配策略对系统隐私保护和拜占庭错误定位能力有重要影响，需要研究如何优化索引分配以平衡这两个关键指标

Method: 在数值稳定拉格朗日编码计算框架下，推导分析边界量化不同索引分配对隐私和鲁棒性的影响，构建优化问题识别最优分配，提出低复杂度贪心策略平衡权衡

Result: 发现隐私最优和鲁棒性最优的索引分配存在根本差异，隐私最大化会降低错误定位能力，反之亦然，贪心策略能有效近似最优平衡

Conclusion: 分布式计算中隐私和鲁棒性存在固有权衡，需要精心设计索引分配策略，提出的贪心方法能有效平衡两者，为实际系统设计提供指导

Abstract: In distributed computing with untrusted workers, the assignment of evaluation indices plays a critical role in determining both privacy and robustness. In this work, we study how the placement of unreliable workers within the Numerically Stable Lagrange Coded Computing (NS-LCC) framework influences privacy and the ability to localize Byzantine errors. We derive analytical bounds that quantify how different evaluation-index assignments affect privacy against colluding curious workers and robustness against Byzantine corruption under finite-precision arithmetic. Using these bounds, we formulate optimization problems that identify privacy-optimal and robustness-optimal index placements and show that the resulting assignments are fundamentally different. This exposes that index choices that maximizes privacy degrade error-localization, and vice versa. To jointly navigate this trade-off, we propose a low-complexity greedy assignment strategy that closely approximates the optimal balance between privacy and robustness.

Motivation: 现有信息新鲜度文献主要分析简单的鞅估计器（使用最新更新作为当前估计），但这种方法远非最优。在基于拉取的更新系统中，最大后验概率(MAP)估计器已知是最优的，但分析上非常困难

Method: 引入新的p-MAP估计器类别，将MAP估计器建模为具有有限阶段的分段常数函数，从而更接近完全表征信息新鲜度建模中的MAP估计器

Result: p-MAP估计器能够将复杂的MAP估计器转化为更易分析的形式，为信息新鲜度分析提供了新的工具

Conclusion: p-MAP估计器是分析信息新鲜度中MAP估计器的有效方法，填补了现有文献中鞅估计器与最优MAP估计器之间的分析空白

Abstract: Most of the contemporary literature on information freshness solely focuses on the analysis of freshness for martingale estimators, which simply use the most recently received update as the current estimate. While martingale estimators are easier to analyze, they are far from optimal, especially in pull-based update systems, where maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are known to be optimal, but are analytically challenging. In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness.

Abstract: Feeding the common-source amplifier output to the back-gate terminal in fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) technology exploits the linearizing effect of negative feedback. Analysis and simulation results in 22 nm FD-SOI show that back-gate feedback sets the overall gain approximately independent of the load, contributes no additional noise, and improves linearity by the back-gate voltage gain. Third-order intercept point (IP3) enhancement is at least $60\times$ compared to without feedback in inverter-based, or complementary common-source, differential amplifiers.

Conclusion: 提出的物理信息机器学习框架能够有效利用同步波形测量数据，在数据稀缺情况下准确估计IBRs暂态响应，为电力系统暂态分析提供了数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.

Abstract: This paper studies the capability of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), when transparently covering a User Equipment (UE), to deceive an adversary monostatic radar system. A compact RIS kernel model that explicitly links the radar's angular response to the RIS phase profile is introduced, enabling an analytical investigation of the Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy with respect to the kernel's power. This model is also leveraged to formulate an RIS-based spoofing design with the dual objective to enforce strict nulls around the UE's true reflection AoA and maximize the channel gain towards a decoy direction. The RIS's deception capability is quantified using point-wise and angle-range robust criteria, and a configuration-independent placement score guiding decoy selection is proposed. Selected numerical results confirm deep nulls at the true reflection AoA together with a pronounced decoy peak, rendering maximum-likelihood sensing at the adversary radar unreliable.

Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) prioritizes task execution over accurate symbol reconstruction and is well-suited to emerging intelligent applications. Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom.

Abstract: This study presents ME-WARD (Multimodal Ergonomic Workplace Assessment and Risk from Data), a novel system for ergonomic assessment and musculoskeletal risk evaluation that implements the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method. ME-WARD is designed to process joint angle data from motion capture systems, including inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based setups, and deep learning human body pose tracking models. The tool's flexibility enables ergonomic risk assessment using any system capable of reliably measuring joint angles, extending the applicability of RULA beyond proprietary setups. To validate its performance, the tool was tested in an industrial setting during the assembly of conveyor belts, which involved high-risk tasks such as inserting rods and pushing conveyor belt components. The experiments leveraged gold standard IMU systems alongside a state-of-the-art monocular 3D pose estimation system. The results confirmed that ME-WARD produces reliable RULA scores that closely align with IMU-derived metrics for flexion-dominated movements and comparable performance with the monocular system, despite limitations in tracking lateral and rotational motions. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiple motion capture technologies into a unified and accessible ergonomic assessment pipeline. By supporting diverse input sources, including low-cost video-based systems, the proposed multimodal approach offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for ergonomic assessments, paving the way for broader adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.

Abstract: An end-to-end hardware-software pipeline is introduced to automatize ergonomics assessment in industrial workplaces. The proposed modular solution can interoperate with commercial systems throughout the ergonomics assessment phases involved in the process. The pipeline includes custom-designed Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, two real-time worker movement acquisition tools, inverse kinematics processing and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) report generation. It is based on free tools such as Unity3D and OpenSim to avoid the problems derived from using proprietary technologies, such as security decisions being made under "black box" conditions. Experiments were conducted in an automotive factory in a workplace with WMSDs risk among workers. The proposed solution obtained comparable results to a gold standard solution, reaching measured joint angles a 0.95 cross-correlation and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 10 for elbows and 12 for shoulders between both systems. In addition, the global RULA score difference is lower than 5% between both systems. This work provides a low-cost solution for WMSDs risk assessment in the workplace to reduce musculoskeletal disorders and associated sick leave in industry, impacting the health of workers in the long term. Our study can ease further research and popularize the use of wearable systems for ergonomics analysis allowing these workplace prevention systems to reach different industrial environments.

Abstract: As the population ages rapidly, long-term care (LTC) facilities across North America face growing pressure to monitor residents safely while keeping staff workload manageable. Falls are among the most critical events to monitor due to their timely response requirement, yet frequent false alarms or uncertain detections can overwhelm caregivers and contribute to alarm fatigue. This motivates the design of reliable, whole end-to-end ambient monitoring systems from occupancy and activity awareness to fall and post-fall detection. In this paper, we focus on robust post-fall floor-occupancy detection using an off-the-shelf 60 GHz FMCW radar and evaluate its deployment in a realistic, furnished indoor environment representative of LTC facilities. Post-fall detection is challenging since motion is minimal, and reflections from the floor and surrounding objects can dominate the radar signal return. We compare a vendor-provided digital beamforming (DBF) pipeline against a proposed preprocessing approach based on Capon or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector is applied and evaluated on the resulting range-azimuth maps across 7 participants. The proposed method improves the mean frame-positive rate from 0.823 (DBF) to 0.916 (Proposed).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于雷达的感知是保护隐私的替代方案，但低分辨率SIMO FMCW雷达检测半静态存在（躺、坐、站等微动状态）很困难，因为接近零多普勒能量常被静态杂波淹没。

Method: 提出RASSO方法：在自适应Capon波束形成前，对慢时间FFT（多普勒）网格进行可逆多普勒域非线性重映射，在0 m/s附近密集化多普勒网格，从而提高有效SNR和降低背景方差。

Result: 在真实护理院数据集上，RASSO-RA达到AUC=0.981，在FAR=1%/5%时召回率0.920/0.947，优于传统Capon处理。数据驱动模型也受益：帧级CNN达95-99%准确率，序列级CNN-LSTM达99.4-99.6%准确率。

Conclusion: 简单的多普勒域扭曲处理可在真实临床环境中显著提升低分辨率雷达对半静态占用的检测能力，为隐私保护监测提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Radar-based sensing is a promising privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and wearables in settings such as long-term care. Yet detecting quasi-static presence (lying, sitting, or standing with only subtle micro-motions) is difficult for low-resolution SIMO FMCW radar because near-zero Doppler energy is often buried under static clutter. We present Respiratory-Amplification Semi-Static Occupancy (RASSO), an invertible Doppler-domain non-linear remapping that densifies the slow-time FFT (Doppler) grid around 0 m/s before adaptive Capon beamforming. The resulting range-azimuth (RA) maps exhibit higher effective SNR, sharper target peaks, and lower background variance, making thresholding and learning more reliable. On a real nursing-home dataset collected with a short-range 1Tx-3Rx radar, RASSO-RA improves classical detection performance, achieving AUC = 0.981 and recall = 0.920/0.947 at FAR = 1%/5%, outperforming conventional Capon processing and a recent baseline. RASSO-RA also benefits data-driven models: a frame-based CNN reaches 95-99% accuracy and a sequence-based CNN-LSTM reaches 99.4-99.6% accuracy across subjects. A paired session-level bootstrap test confirms statistically significant macro-F1 gains of 2.6-3.6 points (95% confidence intervals above zero) over the non-warped pipeline. These results show that simple Doppler-domain warping before spatial processing can materially improve semi-static occupancy detection with low-resolution radar in real clinical environments.

Conclusion: S-MDMA框架有效解决了卫星-地面语义通信中的带宽限制和用户干扰问题，为多用户场景提供了高效可靠的语义传输方案。

Abstract: Satellite-ground semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to play a pivotal role in convergence of communication and AI (ComAI), particularly in enabling intelligent and efficient multi-user data transmission. However, the inherent bandwidth constraints and user interference in satellite-ground systems pose significant challenges to semantic fidelity and transmission robustness. To address these issues, we propose a sensitivity-aware model division multiple access (S-MDMA) framework tailored for bandwidth-limited multi-user scenarios. The proposed framework first performs semantic extraction and merging based on the MDMA architecture to consolidate redundant information. To further improve transmission efficiency, a semantic sensitivity sorting algorithm is presented, which can selectively retain key semantic features. In addition, to mitigate inter-user interference, the framework incorporates orthogonal embedding of semantic features and introduces a multi-user reconstruction loss function to guide joint optimization. Experimental results on open-source datasets demonstrate that S-MDMA consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving robust and high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and user configurations.

Abstract: The recently envisioned goal-oriented communications paradigm calls for the application of inference on wirelessly transferred data via Machine Learning (ML) tools. An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel aerial backhaul architecture that employs an aerial active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to achieve energy-efficient, {full 3D coverage including UAV-BSs and ground users in 6G wireless networks}. Unlike prior aerial-RIS approaches limited to {2D coverage with only servicing ground users} or passive operation, the proposed design integrates an active-RIS onto a high-altitude aerial platform, enabling reliable line-of-sight links and overcoming multiplicative fading through amplification. In a scenario with UAV-BSs deployed to handle sudden traffic surges in urban areas, the aerial-active-RIS both reflects and amplifies backhaul signals to overcome blockage. We jointly optimize the aerial platform placement, array partitioning, and RIS phase configuration to maximize UAV-BS energy-efficiency. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential to deliver resilient backhaul connectivity with comprehensive 3D coverage in 6G networks.

Abstract: The success of large-scale language models has established tokens as compact and meaningful units for natural-language representation, which motivates token communication over wireless channels, where tokens are considered fundamental units for wireless transmission. We propose a context-aware token communication framework that uses a pretrained masked language model (MLM) as a shared contextual probability model between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). At Rx, we develop an iterative token detection method that jointly exploits MLM-guided contextual priors and channel observations based on a Bayesian perspective. At Tx, we additionally introduce a context-aware masking strategy which skips highly predictable token transmission to reduce transmission rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves reconstructed sentence quality and supports effective rate adaptation under various channel conditions.

Abstract: As an emerging wireless communication technology, movable antennas (MAs) offer the ability to adjust the spatial correlation of steering vectors, enabling more flexible beamforming compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs for two typical near-field beamforming scenarios: beam nulling and multi-beam forming. In the first scenario, we aim to jointly optimize the positions of multiple MAs and the beamforming vector to maximize the beam gain toward a desired direction while nulling interference toward multiple undesired directions. In the second scenario, the objective is to maximize the minimum beam gain among all the above directions. However, both problems are non-convex and challenging to solve optimally. To gain insights, we first analyze several special cases and show that, with proper positioning of the MAs, directing the beam toward a specific direction can lead to nulls or full gains in other directions in the two scenarios, respectively. For the general cases, we propose a discrete sampling method and an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions to the two formulated problems. Furthermore, considering the practical limitations in antenna positioning accuracy, we analyze the impact of position errors on the performance of the optimized beamforming and MA positions, by introducing a Taylor series approximation for the near-field beam gain at each target. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Learning robust radar perception models directly from real measurements is costly due to the need for controlled experiments, repeated calibration, and extensive annotation. This paper proposes a lightweight simulation-to-real (sim2real) framework that enables reliable Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar occupancy detection and people counting using only a physics-informed geometric simulator and a small unlabeled real calibration set. We introduce calibrated domain randomization (CDR) to align the global noise-floor statistics of simulated range-Doppler (RD) maps with those observed in real environments while preserving discriminative micro-Doppler structure. Across real-world evaluations, ResNet18 models trained purely on CDR-adjusted simulation achieve 97 percent accuracy for occupancy detection and 72 percent accuracy for people counting, outperforming ray-tracing baseline simulation and conventional random domain randomization baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ELAA-OFDM系统中多用户信道估计问题，传统正交导频方案训练开销过大，需要开发能支持更多用户且降低导频开销的高效估计方法。

Method: 将接收信号建模为三阶低秩张量：LoS场景使用CPD分解，NLoS场景使用BTD分解；采用ALS和NLS算法分别进行分解，从因子矩阵中提取信道参数。

Result: 仿真表明该方法比基于压缩感知的方法获得显著更高的信道估计精度；在导频符号远少于用户数时仍有效，大幅降低训练开销；LoS场景下还能精确定位用户位置。

Conclusion: 提出的张量分解框架为ELAA-OFDM系统提供高效的多用户信道估计方案，在降低训练开销的同时保持高精度，并具备用户定位能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of uplink channel estimation for near-filed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where a base station (BS), equipped with an extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA), serves multiple users over the same time-frequency resource block. A non-orthogonal pilot transmission scheme is considered to accommodate a larger number of users that can be supported by ELAA systems without incurring an excessive amount of training overhead. To facilitate efficient multi-user channel estimation, we express the received signal as a third-order low-rank tensor, which admits a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) model for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios and a block term decomposition (BTD) model for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. An alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm and a non-linear least squares (NLS) algorithm are employed to perform CPD and BTD, respectively. Channel parameters are then efficiently extracted from the recovered factor matrices. By exploiting the geometry of the propagation paths in the estimated channel, users' positions can be precisely determined in LoS scenarios. Moreover, our uniqueness analysis shows that the proposed tensor-based joint multi-user channel estimation framework is effective even when the number of pilot symbols is much smaller than the number of users, revealing its potential in training overhead reduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves markedly higher channel estimation accuracy than compressed sensing (CS)-based approaches.

Abstract: Hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (HRIS) enhance wireless systems by combining passive reflection with active signal amplification. However, jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming with the HRIS reflection and amplification coefficients to maximize spectral efficiency (SE) is a non-convex problem, and conventional iterative solutions are computationally intensive. To address this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that learns a direct mapping from channel state information to the near-optimal transmit beamforming and HRIS configurations. The DRL model is trained offline, after which it can compute the beamforming and HRIS configurations with low complexity and latency. Simulation results demonstrate that our DRL-based method achieves 95% of the SE obtained by the alternating optimization benchmark, while significantly lowering the computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G通信系统的发展，信道状态信息(CSI)对提升网络性能至关重要。传统信道图绘制方法将高维CSI数据映射到低维空间以揭示无线信道的几何结构，但大多数现有方法专注于学习静态几何结构，忽略了信道随时间变化的动态特性，导致在复杂环境中信道图绘制不稳定且拓扑一致性差。

Abstract: With the development of the sixth-generation (6G) communication system, Channel State Information (CSI) plays a crucial role in improving network performance. Traditional Channel Charting (CC) methods map high-dimensional CSI data to low-dimensional spaces to help reveal the geometric structure of wireless channels. However, most existing CC methods focus on learning static geometric structures and ignore the dynamic nature of the channel over time, leading to instability and poor topological consistency of the channel charting in complex environments. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel time-series channel charting approach based on the integration of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Auto encoders (AE) (LSTM-AE-CC). This method incorporates a temporal modeling mechanism into the traditional CC framework, capturing temporal dependencies in CSI using LSTM and learning continuous latent representations with AE. The proposed method ensures both geometric consistency of the channel and explicit modeling of the time-varying properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional CC methods in various real-world communication scenarios, particularly in terms of channel charting stability, trajectory continuity, and long-term predictability.

Abstract: Integrated localization and communication systems aim to reuse communication waveforms for simultaneous data transmission and localization, but delay resolution is fundamentally limited by the available bandwidth. In practice, large contiguous bandwidths are difficult to obtain due to hardware constraints and spectrum fragmentation. Aggregating non-contiguous narrow bands can increase the effective frequency span, but a non-contiguous frequency layout introduces challenges such as elevated sidelobes and ambiguity in delay estimation. This paper introduces a point-spread-function (PSF)-centric framework for dual-band OFDM delay estimation. We model the observed delay profile as the convolution of the true target response with a PSF determined by the dual-band subcarrier selection pattern, explicitly linking band configuration to resolution and ambiguity. To suppress PSF-induced artifacts, we adapt the RELAX algorithm for dual-band multi-target delay estimation. Simulations demonstrate improved robustness and accuracy in dual-band scenarios, supporting ILC under fragmented spectrum.

TL;DR: 论文研究了低分辨率ADC对混合雷达融合系统的影响，发现ADC分辨率存在阈值效应：超过该阈值后通信速率不再显著提升，而感知性能持续受益于更高分辨率，揭示了感知与通信之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集成感知与通信系统中，低分辨率ADC的应用日益重要，但其对混合雷达融合系统的具体影响尚未充分研究。HRF系统中上行链路同时携带直接信号和反射信号，反射信号通常弱得多，使得HRF性能对ADC分辨率特别敏感。

Method: 使用量化Cramér-Rao界来衡量感知精度，推导了到达角估计的量化CRB上界，并通过两个优化问题探索CRB与速率的权衡关系。

Result: 仿真结果表明：当接收信号的动态范围超过ADC支持的动态范围时，HRF变得不可行；UL通信速率在ADC分辨率超过某个阈值后不再显著增加；感知性能持续受益于更高分辨率，揭示了感知与通信性能之间的基本权衡。

Conclusion: ADC分辨率在HRF系统中存在阈值效应，超过该阈值后通信速率增益趋于平缓，而感知性能继续受益。这种权衡关系可以通过CRB-速率边界有效表征，为ISAC系统设计提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Recent advancements have underscored the relevance of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Nevertheless, their specific impact on hybrid radar fusion (HRF) remains largely unexplored. In HRF systems, where uplink (UL) paths carry direct and reflected signals in the same frequency band, the reflected signal is often significantly weaker, making HRF performance particularly sensitive to ADC resolution. To study this effect, we use the quantized Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) to measure sensing accuracy. This work derives an upper bound on the quantized CRB for angle of arrival (AoA) estimation and explores CRB-rate trade-offs through two formulated optimization problems. Simulation results indicate that HRF becomes infeasible when the dynamic range of the received signal exceeds the dynamic range supported by the ADC, which is inherently limited by its resolution. Furthermore, the UL communication rate does not increase significantly when the ADC resolution is raised beyond a certain threshold. These observations highlight a fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication performance: while HRF performance benefits from higher ADC resolutions, the corresponding gains in communication rate plateau. This trade-off is effectively characterized using CRB-rate boundaries derived through simulation.

Abstract: To enable Integrated Communications and Sensing (ICAS) in a peer-to-peer vehicular network, precise synchronization in frequency and phase among the communicating entities is required. In addition, self-driving cars need accurate position estimates of the surrounding vehicles. In this work, we propose a joint, distributed synchronization and localization scheme for a network of communicating entities. Our proposed scheme is mostly signal-agnostic and therefore can be applied to a wide range of possible ICAS signals. We also mitigate the effect of finite sampling frequencies, which otherwise would degrade the synchronization and localization performance severely.

Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.
