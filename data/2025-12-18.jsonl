However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively."}

In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be \"detained\" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept \"information debt\" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a \"band fashion\" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels."}

However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results validate the proposed system, showing significant performance gains by jointly exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom of the 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under the TTS protocol."}

Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \\(s(p)\\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \\(p\\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \\(\\max_{1\\le p\\le k} p\\,s^2(p)\\,\\log n\\), which matches the classical \\(k^2\\log n\\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \\(k\\log n\\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound. Empirical simulations across flat, power-law, and exponential signals validate that SEP adapts to profile structure without tuning and outperforms existing algorithms."}

While most existing studies assume perfect channel state information (CSI), we model the impact of coarse quantization noise on both channel estimation and data transmission, yielding a more realistic assessment of system performance under imperfect CSI conditions in the uplink. We develop a tight approximation for the bit-error ratio (BER) of uncoded M-QAM with zero-forcing detection, based on the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) channel estimate. These analytical results enable compensation strategies that jointly optimize quantization resolution, transmit power, and pilot length across different numbers of users and base station antennas. We further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework through several design scenarios that highlight its effectiveness in optimizing system parameters and improving energy efficiency under quantization constraints. For example, in a 16-QAM system, extending the pilot sequence by 2.5 times and lowering transmit power by 0.5 dB enables a 3-bit quantized system to match the BER of the full-resolution case. The proposed framework offers a fast and accurate alternative to Monte Carlo simulations, enabling practical system optimization under realistic quantization constraints."}

The residual TS errors (RTSE) cause \\emph{partial sample mismatch}, degrading symbol detection performance. To address this, we propose a new AmBC symbol detection framework that incorporates the BT's current and adjacent symbols, as well as channel coefficients. Using energy detector (ED) as a case study, we derive both exact and approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions. Our results show that the ED's BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE, with the symbol detection threshold optimized under the assumption of perfect TS. We then derive a closed-form expression for a near-optimal symbol detection threshold that minimizes BER under RTSE. To estimate the required parameters for the detection threshold, we propose a novel method exploiting the attributes of the BR's received signal samples.

The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Additionally, we analytically elucidate the reasons behind the inherent performance floor of greedy-based methods and highlight the critical role of angular information in algorithm design.

Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF obtained from wu-MRSI and GRE showed good agreement with 0 ppm/5.5% bias and +-0.05 ppm/ +- 12.75% limits-of-agreement. Conclusion: High-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping of the human brain can be obtained simultaneously by ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 min. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolite signal, eliminating the need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions."}

In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "summary": "Target classification is a fundamental task in radar systems, and its performance critically depends on the quantization precision of the signal. While high-precision quantization (e.g. 16-bit) is well established, 1-bit quantization offers distinct advantages by enabling direct sampling at high frequencies and eliminating complex intermediate stages. However, its extreme quantization leads to significant information loss. Although higher sampling rates can compensate for this loss, such oversampling is impractical at the high frequencies targeted for direct sampling. To achieve high-accuracy classification directly from 1-bit radar data under the same sampling rate, this paper proposes a novel two-stage deep learning framework, CF-Net. First, we introduce a self-supervised pre-training strategy based on a dual-branch U-Net architecture. This network learns to restore high-fidelity 16-bit images from their 1-bit counterparts via a cross-feature reconstruction task, forcing the 1-bit encoder to learn robust features despite extreme quantization. Subsequently, this pre-trained encoder is repurposed and fine-tuned for the downstream multi-class target classification task. Experiments on two radar target datasets demonstrate that CF-Net can effectively extract discriminative features from 1-bit imagery, achieving comparable and even superior accuracy to some 16-bit methods without oversampling."}

Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments.

For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios."}

Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems."}

Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction."}

However, quantitatively accurate results require accurate optical fluence estimates. Robust modeling in heterogeneous tissue, where light with different wavelengths can experience significantly different absorption and scattering, is difficult. In this work, we developed a deep neural network (Hybrid-Net) for sPA imaging to simultaneously estimate sO2 in blood vessels and segment those vessels from surrounding background tissue. sO2 error was minimized only in blood vessels segmented in Hybrid-Net, resulting in more accurate predictions. Hybrid-Net was first trained on simulated sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) representing initial pressure distributions from three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue. Then, for experimental verification, the network was retrained on experimental sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) acquired from simple tissue mimicking phantoms with an embedded blood pool. Quantitative measures were used to evaluate Hybrid-Net performance with an averaged segmentation accuracy of >= 0.978 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.998 in the experiment, and an averaged sO2 mean squared error of <= 0.048 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.003 in the experiment.

To achieve long-range communication with low power consumption at a low cost, LoRa uses a chirp spread spectrum modulation and transmits in the sub-GHz unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands. Due to the rapid densification of IoT networks, it is crucial to obtain tailored channel models to evaluate the performance of LoRa networks. While channel models for cellular technologies have been investigated extensively, specific characteristics of LoRa transmissions operating at long range with a rather small (~ 250kHz) bandwidth require dedicated measurement campaigns and modeling efforts. In this work, we leverage an SDR-based testbed to gather and publish a dataset of LoRa frames transmitted in a campus environment. The dataset includes IQ samples of the received frames at multiple locations and allows for the evaluation of channel variations with high time resolution. Using the gathered data, we derive empirical propagation channel models for LoRa that include receiver correlation over distance for three scenarios: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) line-of-sight (LoS), UAV non-LoS, and pedestrian non-LoS.

This study presents a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of pediatric iris recognition, analyzing 276 subjects enrolled between ages 4-12 and followed up to nine years through adolescence. Using 18,318 near-infrared iris images acquired semi-annually, we evaluated commercial (VeriEye) and open-source (OpenIris) systems through linear mixed-effects models that disentangle enrollment age, developmental maturation, and elapsed time while controlling for image quality and physiological factors. False non-match rates remained below 0.5% across the nine-year period for both matchers using pediatric-calibrated thresholds, approaching adult-level performance. However, we reveal significant algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors: VeriEye's apparent decline reflects developmental confounding across enrollment cohorts rather than genuine template aging, while OpenIris exhibits modest but genuine temporal aging (0.5 standard deviations over eight years). Image quality and pupil dilation constancy dominated longitudinal performance, with dilation effects reaching 3.0-3.5 standard deviations, substantially exceeding temporal factors. Failures concentrated in 9.4% of subjects with persistent acquisition challenges rather than accumulating with elapsed time, confirming acquisition conditions as the primary limitation. These findings justify extending conservative re-enrollment policies, potentially to 10-12 year validity periods for high-quality enrollments at ages 7+, and demonstrate iris recognition remains viable throughout childhood and adolescence with proper imaging control."}

Traditional semiconductor-based RISs face scalability issues due to high power consumption. Meanwhile, liquid crystal-based RISs (LC-RISs) offer energy-efficient and cost-effective operation even for large arrays. However, this promise has a caveat. LC-RISs suffer from long reconfiguration times, on the order of tens of milliseconds, which limits their applicability in dynamic scenarios. To date, prior works have focused on hardware design aspects or static scenarios to address this limitation, but little attention has been paid to optimization solutions for dynamic settings. Our paper fills this gap by proposing a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework to dynamically control the phase shifts of LC-RISs and maximize the data rate of a moving user. Specifically, we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that adapts the LC-RIS phase shifts without requiring perfect channel state information and balances the tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and configuration time. We validate our approach through high-fidelity ray tracing simulations, leveraging measurement data from an LC-RIS prototype. Our results demonstrate the potential of our solution to bring adaptive control to dynamic LC-RIS-assisted mmWave systems."}

This paper introduces the Moment-Matching Estimation Technique (MoMET), a low-complexity method for estimating the mean DOA, spread, and power of a narrow diffuse source without requiring prior knowledge on the source distribution. The unknown source density is characterized by its mean DOA and its first central moments, which are estimated through covariance matching techniques which fit the empirical covariance of the measurements to that modeled from the moments. The MoMET parameterization is robust to incorrect model assumptions, and numerically efficient. The asymptotic bias and covariance of the new estimator are derived and its performance is demonstrated through simulations."}

We provide solutions to both challenges through a comprehensive analysis for the asymptotic performance of DL-AMF under large dimensional regime (LDR) where the dimension N and sample size K tend to infinity whereas their ratio N/K converges to a constant c\\in(0,1). The analytical results show that any DL detectors constructed by normalizing the random variable |a|2=|sH(R+λIN)-1y0|2 with a deterministic quantity or a random variable that converges almost surely to a deterministic value will exhibit equivalent performance under LDR. Following this idea, we derive two CFAR DL detectors: CFAR DL semi-clairvoyant matched filter (CFAR-DL-SCMF) detector and CFAR DL adaptive matched filter (CFAR-DL-AMF) detector, by normalizing |a|2 with an appropriate deterministic quantity and its consistent estimate, respectively. The theoretical analysis and simulations show that both CFAR-DL-SCMF and CFAR-DL-AMF achieve CFAR with respect to covariance matrix, target steering vector and loading factor. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotically optimal loading factor λ_opt by maximizing the explicit expression of asymptotic Pd. For practical implementation, we provide a consistent estimator for λ_opt under LDR. Based on λ_opt and its consistent estimate, we establish the optimal CFAR-DL-SCMF (opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF) and the optimal CFAR-DL-AMF (opt-CFAR-DL-AMF). Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF and opt-CFAR-DL-AMF consistently outperform EL-AMF and persymmetric AMF in both full-rank and low-rank clutter plus noise environments."}

However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach designed to optimize throughput and extend network lifetime of an energy-constrained CIoT system under jamming attacks. This DRL framework equips a CIoT device with the autonomy to manage energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission, while also regulating its transmit power to respect spectrum-sharing constraints. We formulate the optimization problem under various constraints, and we model the CIoT device's interactions within the channel as a model-free Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP serves as a foundation to develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN), designed to help the CIoT agent learn the optimal communication policy to navigate challenges such as dynamic channel occupancy, jamming attacks, and channel fading while achieving its goal. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, named UCB-IA, which enhances the CIoT network's ability to efficiently navigate jamming attacks within the channel. The proposed DRL algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge and uses locally observable information such as channel occupancy, jamming activity, channel gain, and energy arrival to make decisions. Extensive simulations prove that our proposed DRL algorithm that utilizes the UCB-IA strategy surpasses existing benchmarks, allowing for a more adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing in CIoT networks."}
