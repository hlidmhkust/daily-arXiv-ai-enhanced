### [1] [User-Intent-Driven Semantic Communication via Adaptive Deep Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05884)
*Peigen Ye,Jingpu Duan,Hongyang Du,Yulan Guo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种用户意图驱动的语义通信系统，通过多模态大模型和注意力模块提升意图理解和传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信系统虽能提取关键语义，但未能深入理解和泛化用户真实意图。

Method: 整合多模态大模型生成用户意图先验，提出掩码引导注意力模块和信道状态感知模块。

Result: 在瑞利信道下，PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS分别提升8%、6%和19%。

Conclusion: 系统能深度理解用户意图，并在不同信道条件下实现鲁棒传输。

Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on transmitting task-relevant semantic
information, aiming for intent-oriented communication. While existing systems
improve efficiency by extracting key semantics, they still fail to deeply
understand and generalize users' real intentions. To overcome this, we propose
a user-intention-driven semantic communication system that interprets diverse
abstract intents. First, we integrate a multi-modal large model as semantic
knowledge base to generate user-intention prior. Next, a mask-guided attention
module is proposed to effectively highlight critical semantic regions. Further,
a channel state awareness module ensures adaptive, robust transmission across
varying channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system
achieves deep intent understanding and outperforms DeepJSCC, e.g., under a
Rayleigh channel at an SNR of 5 dB, it achieves improvements of 8%, 6%, and 19%
in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, respectively.

### [2] [On MDS Convertible Codes in the Merge Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06219)
*Vinayak Ramkumar,Xiangliang Kong,G. Yeswanth Sai,Myna Vajha,M. Nikhil Krishnan*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在大规模分布式存储系统中，通过可转换码（convertible codes）实现不同参数代码间的高效转换，以优化访问成本和带宽成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应不同磁盘故障率的代码参数调整可以显著节省存储空间而不影响可靠性，因此需要设计可转换码以实现高效转换。

Method: 提出了三种构造方法，分别针对不同参数范围，优化访问成本；并提出一种优化带宽成本的构造方法。

Result: 前三种构造方法在访问成本上达到最优，第三种构造方法在几乎所有情况下匹配MDS猜想的下界；带宽优化构造方法减少了子分组化。

Conclusion: 可转换码的设计能够有效优化存储系统的访问和带宽成本，同时满足不同参数需求。

Abstract: In large-scale distributed storage systems, erasure coding is employed to
ensure reliability against disk failures. Recent work by Kadekodi et al.
demonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can
lead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such
adaptations, known as \emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of
\emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes
of different parameters.
  In this work, we study the setting in which $\lambda$ codewords of an initial
$[n^I = k^I + r^I,\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a
final $[n^F = \lambda k^I + r^F,\, k^F = \lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by
presenting three constructions that achieve optimal \emph{access cost}, defined
as the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first
two constructions apply when $\lambda \leq r^I$ and impose specific
divisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize
both the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which
builds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting
arbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that
are linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction
achieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS
conjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that
optimizes the \emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols
transmitted during conversion. This scheme is a refinement of Maturana and
Rashmi's bandwidth-optimal construction based on the piggybacking framework,
and achieves reduced sub-packetization.

### [3] [A New Framework for the Sum of Squared $κ$-$μ$ RVs with Application to Sub-THz Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06242)
*Gustavo Rodrigues de Lima Tejerina,Italo Atzeni*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于$\kappa$-$\mu$模型的子太赫兹频段传播分析方法，推导了多天线系统中接收信号功率的新表示形式，具有高效计算和易用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究子太赫兹频段的多天线系统传播特性，解决现有方法计算复杂和难以应用的问题。

Method: 采用$\kappa$-$\mu$模型，推导了独立同分布随机变量平方和的精确表示，并分析了其概率密度函数和累积分布函数。

Result: 提出了高效的计算框架，适用于大规模天线阵列系统，并推导了覆盖概率和误码率的表达式。

Conclusion: 新方法在计算效率和易用性上优于现有方法，适用于子太赫兹频段的多天线系统性能分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt the $\kappa$-$\mu$ model to characterize the
propagation in the sub-THz band. We develop a new exact representation of the
sum of squared independent and identically distributed $\kappa$-$\mu$ random
variables, which can be used to express the power of the received signal in
multi-antenna systems. Unlike existing ones, the proposed analytical framework
is remarkably tractable and computationally efficient, and thus can be
conveniently employed to analyze systems with massive antenna arrays. We derive
novel expressions for the probability density function and cumulative
distribution function, analyze their convergence and truncation error, and
discuss the computational complexity and the implementation aspects. Moreover,
we derive expressions for the coverage probability and bit error probability
for coherent binary modulations. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of an
uplink sub-THz system where a single-antenna user is served by a base station
employing maximum ratio combining.

### [4] [Transformer-Based Explainable Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography: The MammoFormer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06137)
*Ojonugwa Oluwafemi Ejiga Peter,Daniel Emakporuena,Bamidele Dayo Tunde,Maryam Abdulkarim,Abdullahi Bn Umar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MammoFormer框架结合Transformer架构和多特征增强技术，解决CNN在乳腺X光片分析中的局限性，提供可解释AI功能，性能提升达13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光片检测因微小异常和解读差异而困难，CNN在局部和全局信息处理及可解释性上存在不足。

Method: 开发MammoFormer框架，结合Transformer架构、多特征增强和XAI功能，测试七种架构和四种增强技术。

Result: ViT结合AHE达98.3%准确率，Swin Transformer通过HOG增强性能提升13%。

Conclusion: MammoFormer通过优化架构和增强技术，性能优于CNN，并提供临床可接受的解释性。

Abstract: Breast cancer detection through mammography interpretation remains difficult
because of the minimal nature of abnormalities that experts need to identify
alongside the variable interpretations between readers. The potential of CNNs
for medical image analysis faces two limitations: they fail to process both
local information and wide contextual data adequately, and do not provide
explainable AI (XAI) operations that doctors need to accept them in clinics.
The researcher developed the MammoFormer framework, which unites
transformer-based architecture with multi-feature enhancement components and
XAI functionalities within one framework. Seven different architectures
consisting of CNNs, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and ConvNext were
tested alongside four enhancement techniques, including original images,
negative transformation, adaptive histogram equalization, and histogram of
oriented gradients. The MammoFormer framework addresses critical clinical
adoption barriers of AI mammography systems through: (1) systematic
optimization of transformer architectures via architecture-specific feature
enhancement, achieving up to 13% performance improvement, (2) comprehensive
explainable AI integration providing multi-perspective diagnostic
interpretability, and (3) a clinically deployable ensemble system combining CNN
reliability with transformer global context modeling. The combination of
transformer models with suitable feature enhancements enables them to achieve
equal or better results than CNN approaches. ViT achieves 98.3% accuracy
alongside AHE while Swin Transformer gains a 13.0% advantage through HOG
enhancements

### [5] [Clinically-guided Data Synthesis for Laryngeal Lesion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06182)
*Chiara Baldini,Kaisar Kushibar,Richard Osuala,Simone Balocco,Oliver Diaz,Karim Lekadir,Leonardo S. Mattos*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用潜在扩散模型（LDM）和ControlNet适配器生成喉镜图像-标注对的方法，以解决数据稀缺问题，并提升计算机辅助诊断/检测（CADx/e）系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前喉镜CADx/e系统面临数据稀缺和标注不足的问题，限制了其在临床中的应用。

Method: 采用LDM和ControlNet生成合成图像-标注对，并通过临床观察指导扩散过程，生成高质量且临床相关的图像。

Result: 仅添加10%的合成数据，检测率在内部测试中提高了9%，在外部数据中提高了22.1%。专家对合成图像的真实性评价较高。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径，并展示了合成数据在现实场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Although computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) systems have
made significant progress in various medical domains, their application is
still limited in specialized fields such as otorhinolaryngology. In the latter,
current assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high
heterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the
gold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck
for specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated
datasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study
introduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)
coupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic
image-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses
data scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,
high-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse
anatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand
training datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in
laryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of
only 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%
when the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.
Additionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5
expert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence
in distinguishing synthetic from real images. This work has the potential to
accelerate the development of automated tools for laryngeal disease diagnosis,
offering a solution to data scarcity and demonstrating the applicability of
synthetic data in real-world scenarios.

### [6] [Deep Learning Based Reconstruction Methods for Electrical Impedance Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06281)
*Alexander Denker,Fabio Margotti,Jianfeng Ning,Kim Knudsen,Derick Nganyu Tanyu,Bangti Jin,Andreas Hauptmann,Peter Maass*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了使用深度神经网络解决EIT逆问题的学习方法，比较了多种学习方法和传统模型方法，结果表明学习方法在分布内数据上表现更优，但泛化能力有限，混合方法在准确性和适应性上表现较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT逆问题在医学、工业和环境监测中具有重要应用，但其严重不适定性需要先进的计算方法。近年来深度学习的进展为EIT图像重建提供了新思路。

Method: 论文比较了完全学习、后处理和迭代学习等深度学习方法，以及稀疏正则化、正则化高斯-牛顿迭代和水平集方法等传统模型方法。

Result: 学习方法在分布内数据上优于传统方法，但泛化能力有限；混合方法在准确性和适应性上表现较好。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在EIT逆问题中具有潜力，但需结合传统方法以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a powerful imaging modality widely
used in medical diagnostics, industrial monitoring, and environmental studies.
The EIT inverse problem is about inferring the internal conductivity
distribution of the concerned object from the voltage measurements taken on its
boundary. This problem is severely ill-posed, and requires advanced
computational approaches for accurate and reliable image reconstruction. Recent
innovations in both model-based reconstruction and deep learning have driven
significant progress in the field. In this review, we explore learned
reconstruction methods that employ deep neural networks for solving the EIT
inverse problem. The discussion focuses on the complete electrode model, one
popular mathematical model for real-world applications of EIT. We compare a
wide variety of learned approaches, including fully-learned, post-processing
and learned iterative methods, with several conventional model-based
reconstruction techniques, e.g., sparsity regularization, regularized
Gauss-Newton iteration and level set method. The evaluation is based on three
datasets: a simulated dataset of ellipses, an out-of-distribution simulated
dataset, and the KIT4 dataset, including real-world measurements. Our results
demonstrate that learned methods outperform model-based methods for
in-distribution data but face challenges in generalization, where hybrid
methods exhibit a good balance of accuracy and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是全球常见的高死亡率癌症，CT图像因其低成本和处理速度快成为主要诊断手段，但现有技术因数据不平衡导致高误诊率。

Method: 采用DenseNet201模型，结合Focal Loss、数据增强和正则化技术，解决数据不平衡和过拟合问题。

Result: 方法表现出色，准确率达到98.95%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在肺癌检测和分类中表现出高效性和准确性，为解决数据不平衡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers and is one
of the most common causes of death for men and women worldwide. Computed
Tomography (CT) images are the most preferred diagnosis method because of their
low cost and their faster processing times. Many researchers have proposed
various ways of identifying lung cancer using CT images. However, such
techniques suffer from significant false positives, leading to low accuracy.
The fundamental reason results from employing a small and imbalanced dataset.
This paper introduces an innovative approach for LC detection and
classification from CT images based on the DenseNet201 model. Our approach
comprises several advanced methods such as Focal Loss, data augmentation, and
regularization to overcome the imbalanced data issue and overfitting challenge.
The findings show the appropriateness of the proposal, attaining a promising
performance of 98.95% accuracy.

### [8] [Multivariate Fields of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06490)
*Stanislas Ducotterd,Michael Unser*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像先验学习框架——多元专家场，通过引入基于$\ell_\infty$-范数的Moreau包络构造多元势函数，在多种逆问题中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专家场方法局限于单变量模型，无法充分利用图像数据的多元特性，因此需要一种更通用的框架。

Method: 采用$\ell_\infty$-范数的Moreau包络构造多元势函数，扩展了专家场模型。

Result: 在去噪、去模糊、压缩感知MRI和CT等任务中表现优于单变量模型，接近深度学习方法的性能，但速度更快、参数更少、数据需求更低。

Conclusion: 多元专家场框架在性能和效率上取得平衡，同时保持了较高的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce the multivariate fields of experts, a new framework for the
learning of image priors. Our model generalizes existing fields of experts
methods by incorporating multivariate potential functions constructed via
Moreau envelopes of the $\ell_\infty$-norm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposal across a range of inverse problems that include image denoising,
deblurring, compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging, and computed
tomography. The proposed approach outperforms comparable univariate models and
achieves performance close to that of deep-learning-based regularizers while
being significantly faster, requiring fewer parameters, and being trained on
substantially fewer data. In addition, our model retains a relatively high
level of interpretability due to its structured design.

Result: 通过仿真验证了理论结果，并评估了关键参数对检测性能的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论最优性和实现实用性之间架起桥梁，为6G系统中的IRS辅助物联网网络提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of activity detection in distributed
Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where devices employ asynchronous
transmissions with heterogeneous power levels to report their local
observations. The system leverages an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to
enhance detection reliability, with optional incorporation of a direct
line-of-sight (LoS) path. We formulate the detection problem as a binary
hypothesis test and develop four detectors: an optimal detector alongside three
computationally efficient detectors designed for practical scenarios with
different levels of prior knowledge about noise variance, channel state
information, and device transmit powers. For each detector, we derive
closed-form expressions for both detection and false alarm probabilities,
establishing theoretical performance benchmarks. Extensive simulations validate
our analytical results and systematically evaluate the impact of key system
parameters including the number of antennas, samples, users, and IRS elements
on detection performance. The proposed framework effectively bridges
theoretical optimality with implementation practicality, providing a scalable
solution for IRS-assisted IoT networks in emerging 6G systems.

### [10] [A Remark on the AAA Method for Secret-Key Generation in Mobile Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05801)
*Yingbo Hua*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广泛适用的密钥生成方法（AAA方法），并证明了其性能的鲁棒性。即使存在相关性或泄漏，只要Eve无法完全捕获每个数据包，密钥的混淆度会随着叠加次数增加而趋于完美。同时，论文比较了AAA方法与基于互易信道估计的理想方法，展示了AAA方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究一种广泛适用的密钥生成方法，并验证其在存在相关性和泄漏情况下的性能鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AAA方法，分析其在叠加数据包存在相关性和泄漏时的性能，并与理想方法进行比较。

Result: AAA方法在叠加次数趋于无限时，密钥混淆度趋于完美。与理想方法相比，AAA方法具有多项优势。

Conclusion: AAA方法在密钥生成中表现出鲁棒性和优越性，适用于广泛场景。

Abstract: A broadly applicable method for secret-key generation is named for its
accumulative, adaptable and additive (AAA) properties. This paper first shows a
robustness of its performance. Namely, even if there is an inter correlation or
a leakage caused intra correlation among the superimposed packets, provided
there is a nonzero probability for each packet to be missed in full or in part
by Eve, then the equivocation of the key generated by the AAA method always
becomes perfect as the number of superpositions becomes infinite. Also shown in
this paper is a comparison between the AAA method and an ideal method based on
reciprocal channel estimation, which reveals several advantages of the AAA
method.

Result: 啁啾波形在高移动性通信和集成感知与通信（ISAC）中表现出优势。

Conclusion: 论文总结了啁啾信号设计的优势，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: To meet the increasingly demanding quality-of-service requirements of the
next-generation multi-carrier mobile networks, it is essential to design
multi-functional signalling schemes facilitating efficient, flexible, and
reliable communication and sensing in complex wireless environments. As a
compelling candidate, we advocate chirp signalling, beneficially amalgamating
sequences (e.g., Zadoff-Chu sequences) with waveforms (e.g., chirp spread
spectrum and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar), given their
resilience against doubly selective channels. Besides chirp sequences, a wide
range of chirp waveforms is considered, ranging from FMCW to affine
frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM), to create a promising chirp
multicarrier waveform. This study also highlights the advantages of such
waveforms in supporting reliable high-mobility communications, plus integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC). Finally, we outline several emerging
research directions for chirp signalling designs.

Result: STEEP在多种实际场景中能提供足够的保密速率，支持一次性密码本加密。

Conclusion: STEEP在成本、复杂性、兼容性和抗持续窃听方面优于QKD，是一种有潜力的替代方案。

Abstract: Secret-message transmission by echoing encrypted probes (STEEP) is discussed
as an alternative to quantum key distribution (QKD). The former only needs
classic or non-quantum channels while the latter needs both quantum and classic
channels for secret-key generation. STEEP is shown to yield a secrecy rate
sufficient for one-time pads encryption in many practical situations including
in-air channels or undersea optical cables. Other advantages of STEEP over QKD
include cost, complexity, compatibility, and robustness against constant
eavesdropping.

### [13] [Bayesian Radio Map Estimation: Fundamentals and Implementation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06037)
*Tien Ngoc Ha,Daniel Romero*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的贝叶斯估计器，用于无线电地图估计（RME），旨在确定给定测量值后地图的后验分布，从而支持任意地图功能的最小均方误差估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯方法主要关注地图本身估计，而本文旨在更全面地利用贝叶斯框架，解决后验分布问题，以支持更多功能估计。

Method: 提出基于条件扩散模型的通用贝叶斯估计器，并对比分析贝叶斯与非贝叶斯方法的优劣。

Result: 贝叶斯方法在不确定性处理和功能估计方面表现更优，尤其在支持任意地图功能的最小均方误差估计时。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在特定场景下优于非贝叶斯方法，尤其是在需要处理不确定性和多功能估计时。

Abstract: Radio map estimation (RME) is the problem of inferring the value of a certain
metric (e.g. signal power) across an area of interest given a collection of
measurements. While most works tackle this problem from a purely non-Bayesian
perspective, some Bayesian estimators have been proposed. However, the latter
focus on estimating the map itself, the Bayesian standpoint is adopted mainly
to exploit prior information or to capture uncertainty. This paper pursues a
more general formulation, where the goal is to determine the posterior
distribution of the map given the measurements. Besides handling uncertainty
and allowing standard Bayesian estimates, solving this problem is seen to
enable minimum mean square error estimation of arbitrary map functionals (e.g.
capacity, bit error rate, or coverage area to name a few) while training only
for power estimation. A general Bayesian estimator is proposed based on
conditional diffusion models and both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian paradigms
are compared analytically and numerically to determine when the Bayesian
approach is preferable.

TL;DR: MM-LSCM是一种自监督多模态神经无线电辐射场框架，用于下一代网络优化的局部统计信道建模，结合RSRP数据和LiDAR点云信息，显著提升了信道重建精度和抗噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LSCM方法仅依赖RSRP数据，无法充分建模影响信号传播的环境结构，因此需要一种能结合多模态数据的方法。

Method: 提出双分支神经架构，整合RSRP数据和LiDAR点云信息，采用基于体积渲染的多模态合成和自监督训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，MM-LSCM在信道重建精度和抗噪能力上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: MM-LSCM是一种无需昂贵标注数据的实用解决方案，适用于现实无线网络优化。

Abstract: This paper presents MM-LSCM, a self-supervised multi-modal neural radio
radiance field framework for localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) for
next-generation network optimization. Traditional LSCM methods rely solely on
RSRP data, limiting their ability to model environmental structures that affect
signal propagation. To address this, we propose a dual-branch neural
architecture that integrates RSRP data and LiDAR point cloud information,
enhancing spatial awareness and predictive accuracy. MM-LSCM leverages
volume-rendering-based multi-modal synthesis to align radio propagation with
environmental obstacles and employs a self-supervised training approach,
eliminating the need for costly labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate
that MM-LSCM significantly outperforms conventional methods in channel
reconstruction accuracy and robustness to noise, making it a promising solution
for real-world wireless network optimization.

Abstract: The fast-rising demand for wireless bandwidth requires rapid evolution of
high-performance baseband processing infrastructure. Programmable many-core
processors for software-defined radio (SDR) have emerged as high-performance
baseband processing engines, offering the flexibility required to capture
evolving wireless standards and technologies. This trend must be supported by a
design framework enabling functional validation and end-to-end performance
analysis of SDR hardware within realistic radio environment models. We propose
a static binary translation based simulator augmented with a fast, approximate
timing model of the hardware and coupled to wireless channel models to simulate
the most performance-critical physical layer functions implemented in software
on a many (1024) RISC-V cores cluster customized for SDR. Our framework
simulates the detection of a 5G OFDM-symbol on a server-class processor in
9.5s-3min, on a single thread, depending on the input MIMO size (three orders
of magnitude faster than RTL simulation). The simulation is easily parallelized
to 128 threads with 73-121x speedup compared to a single thread.

Abstract: Following the scale-up of new radio (NR) complexity in 5G and beyond, the
physical layer's computing load on base stations is increasing under a strictly
constrained latency and power budget; base stations must process > 20-Gb/s
uplink wireless data rate on the fly, in < 10 W. At the same time, the
programmability and reconfigurability of base station components are the key
requirements; it reduces the time and cost of new networks' deployment, it
lowers the acceptance threshold for industry players to enter the market, and
it ensures return on investments in a fast-paced evolution of standards. In
this article, we present the design of a many-core cluster for 5G and beyond
base station processing. Our design features 1024, streamlined RISC-V cores
with domain-specific FP extensions, and 4-MiB shared memory. It provides the
necessary computational capabilities for software-defined processing of the
lower physical layer of 5G physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), satisfying
high-end throughput requirements (66 Gb/s for a transition time interval (TTI),
9.4-302 Gb/s depending on the processing stage). The throughput metrics for the
implemented functions are ten times higher than in state-of-the-art (SoTA)
application-specific instruction processors (ASIPs). The energy efficiency on
key NR kernels (2-41 Gb/s/W), measured at 800 MHz, 25 {\deg}C, and 0.8 V, on a
placed and routed instance in 12-nm CMOS technology, is competitive with SoTA
architectures. The PUSCH processing runs end-to-end on a single cluster in 1.7
ms, at <6-W average power consumption, achieving 12 Gb/s/W.

Abstract: Deep learning has recently garnered significant interest in wireless
communications due to its superior performance compared to traditional
model-based algorithms. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
demonstrated notable improvements in block error rate (BLER) under various
channel models and mobility scenarios. However, the high computational
complexity and resource demands of deep CNNs pose challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained edge systems. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) Release 20 highlights the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI)
integration in enabling advanced radio-access networks for 6G systems. The hard
real-time processing demands of 5G and 6G require efficient techniques such as
post-training quantization (PTQ), quantization-aware training (QAT), pruning,
and hybrid approaches to meet latency requirements. In this paper, we focus on
PTQ to reduce model complexity by lowering the bit-width of weights, thereby
enhancing computational efficiency. Our analysis employs symmetric uniform
quantization, applying both per-tensor and per-channel PTQ to a neural receiver
achieving performance comparable to full-precision models. Specifically, 8-bit
per-channel quantization maintains BLER performance with minimal degradation,
while 4-bit quantization shows great promise but requires further optimization
to achieve target BLER levels. These results highlight the potential of
ultra-low bitwidth PTQ for efficient neural receiver deployment in 6G systems.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance wireless communication by
dynamically shaping the propagation environment, but their integration
introduces hardware-level security risks. This paper presents the concept of
Malicious RIS (MALRIS), where compromised components behave adversarially, even
under passive operation. The focus of this work is on practical threats such as
manufacturing time tampering, malicious firmware, and partial element control.
Two representative attacks, power-splitting and element-splitting, are modeled
to assess their impact. Simulations in a RIS-assisted system reveal that even a
limited hardware compromise can significantly degrade performance metrics such
as bit error rate, throughput, and secrecy metrics. By exposing this overlooked
threat surface, this work aims to promote awareness and support secure,
trustworthy RIS deployment in future wireless networks.

Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an
important role for low-altitude economy with a wide range of applications like
precise agriculture, aerial delivery and surveillance. Integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) is a key technology to enable the large-scale deployment
and routine usage of UAVs by providing both communication and sensing services
efficiently. For UAV ISAC systems, as UAV often acts as both a communication
user equipment (UE) and a sensing target, traditional ISAC systems that usually
allocate dedicated TF resources for sensing are inefficient due to the severe
degradation of communication spectral efficiency. To address this issue, in
this paper, we propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC framework for UAVs that
eliminates the need for dedicated sensing TF resources, achieving zero TF
sensing overhead. By designing the transmit beamforming to meet the
requirements for both communication and sensing tasks, our proposed approach
enables the communication TF resources to be fully reused for sensing, thereby
enhancing both the communication sum rate and the sensing performance in terms
of resolution, unambiguous range, and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a
low-complexity target searching beamforming algorithm and a two-stage
super-resolution sensing algorithm, which ensure efficient implementation.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-ISAC framework not
only improves the communication sum rate but also outperforms traditional ISAC
systems in sensing performance, making it a promising solution for future ISAC
systems to support low-altitude UAVs.
