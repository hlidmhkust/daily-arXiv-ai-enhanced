In this paper, we aim to resolve\nthis issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based\ngrant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum\na posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation\nproblems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph\nthat captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device\nactivities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based\nalgorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems. Both\nproposed algorithms alleviate the AMP's inherent convergence problem when the\npilot length is smaller or comparable to the number of active devices. Then, we\nanalyze AMP-A-EC's error probability of activity detection and mean square\nerror (MSE) of channel estimation via state evolution and show that AMP-A-AC\nhas the lower computational complexity (in dominant term).

The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by\njointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the\naverage sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting\nstochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample\naverage approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces\nthe expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically\nregenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization\naccurately reflects the current antenna configuration.

Equalization is possible with\na single tap filter, and low-complexity equalization makes OFDM an attractive\nphysical layer. However the performance of OFDM degrades with mobility, since\nDoppler spreads introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) between subcarriers\nand they are no longer orthogonal. Zak-transform based orthogonal time\nfrequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly\nselective channels. Zak-OTFS signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain, converted to time domain (TD) for transmission and reception, then\nreturned to the DD domain for processing. The received signal is a\nsuperposition of many attenuated copies since the doubly selective channel\nintroduces delay and Doppler shifts. The received symbols are more difficult to\nequalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler\naxes.

We show that the\nchannel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate\ngradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that\ncomplexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame.\nFor comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame\ndimension.

Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime\ndevices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the\ngenuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages.\nLeakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general\ninefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways\nleakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and\nexternal leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal\nleakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder\nto detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs.\nWhen leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or\nfailure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage,\nlow leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the\nbasic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system,\nand minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper.

A comprehensive tutorial is presented in\nthis paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS\nsignal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna\nactivation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity\nlimits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance\nmetrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its\nsuperiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching\nbeamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is\nfirst characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general\nmultiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for\nPASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS,\nnamely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical\nprotocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications,\nnamely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing.

Submitted to IEEE", "summary": "This work explores the integration of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA),\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and\nbeyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) to enhance the\nspectral-efficiency, energy-efficiency, coverage, and connectivity of future\nsixth-generation (6G) communication networks. Specifically, with a multiuser\nBD-RIS-empowered RSMA-SWIPT system, we jointly optimize the transmit precoding\nvectors, the common rate proportion of users, the power-splitting ratios, and\nscattering matrix of BD-RIS node, under the assumption of imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI). Additionally, to better capture practical hardware\nbehavior, we incorporate a nonlinear energy harvesting model under energy\nharvesting constraints. We design a robust optimization framework to maximize\nthe system sum-rate, while explicitly accounting for the worst-case impact of\nCSI uncertainties. Further, we introduce an alternating optimization framework\nthat partitions the problem into several blocks, which are optimized\niteratively. More specifically, the transmit precoding vectors are optimized by\nreformulating the problem as a convex semidefinite programming through\nsuccessive-convex approximation (SCA), whereas the power-splitting problem is\nsolved using the MOSEK-enabled CVX toolbox. Subsequently, to optimize the\nscattering matrix of the BD-RIS, we first employ SCA to reformulate the problem\ninto a convex form, and then design a manifold optimization strategy based on\nthe Conjugate-Gradient method. Finally, numerical simulation results reveal\nthat the proposed scheme provides significant performance improvements over\nexisting benchmarks and demonstrates rapid convergence within a reasonable\nnumber of iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86RSMA\u3001SWIPT\u548cBD-RIS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e866G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u53476G\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u6bd4\u548cBD-RIS\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408SCA\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a6G\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
