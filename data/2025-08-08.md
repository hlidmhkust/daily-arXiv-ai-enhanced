### [1] [Energy Efficient Transmitter Creation by Consuming Free Energy in Molecular Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04805)
*Dongliang Jing,Linjuan Li,Zhen Cheng,Lin Lin,Andrew W. Eckford*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种能量高效的分子通信发射器设计，通过分离混合分子优化传输性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境中获取的信息分子通常是混合的，初始浓度相同，限制了高保真传输技术（如MoSK）的应用。

Method: 设计了一个从环境中获取分子并存储在两个储层中的发射器，消耗能量转移分子以分离混合分子。

Result: 转移初始浓度较高的分子能提升性能，每次转移使用较少分子可进一步提高效率。

Conclusion: 通过能量高效的分子转移技术优化分子通信系统。

Abstract: Information molecules play a crucial role in molecular communication (MC),
acting as carriers for information transfer. A common approach to get
information molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;
however, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental
molecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are
identical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as
molecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that
harvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two
reservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer
them between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores
energy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through
theoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for
moving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring
higher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while
using fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing MC systems through energy-efficient
molecule transfer techniques.

### [2] [Energy Efficiency Optimization for Movable Antenna-Aided Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05033)
*Jingze Ding,Zijian Zhou,Yuping Zhao,Bingli Jiao*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了可移动天线系统的能量效率优化，考虑了天线移动带来的时间延迟和能耗，提出了基于连续凸近似的算法，结果显示MA系统比固定天线系统更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨可移动天线系统在能量效率上的潜力，同时考虑天线移动带来的额外开销。

Method: 推导单用户下行链路通信系统的能量效率上限，提出基于连续凸近似的优化算法。

Result: 仿真结果表明，尽管存在移动开销，MA系统仍比固定天线系统更高效。

Conclusion: 可移动天线系统在能量效率优化方面具有潜力，需进一步研究其实际应用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable
antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption
introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency
for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped
with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is
formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on
successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex
optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused
by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared
to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

### [3] [Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05066)
*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对正密度分布的扩展几何Jensen-Shannon散度（extended G-JSD），无需归一化几何混合。通过明确其与G-JSD的差距，并给出上下界，同时推导了多元高斯分布下的闭式解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何Jensen-Shannon散度（G-JSD）因其在正态分布下的闭式解而广受欢迎，但需要归一化几何混合。本文旨在提出一种更通用的扩展版本，适用于正密度分布。

Method: 通过定义扩展G-JSD，明确其与G-JSD的差距，并推导上下界。针对多元高斯分布，给出了闭式解。

Result: 扩展G-JSD适用于更广泛的正密度分布，并在多元高斯分布下具有闭式解。G-JSD和扩展G-JSD可视为普通JSD的正则化形式。

Conclusion: 扩展G-JSD为处理正密度分布提供了更灵活的工具，并在理论和应用上均具有优势。

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

### [4] [Necessity of Block Designs for Optimal Locally Private Distribution Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05110)
*Abigail Gentle*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文证明了在本地差分隐私模型下，任何实现最优误差的协议必须对应于某种平衡不完全区组设计，从而完全刻画了该问题的最优协议集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在本地差分隐私模型中，是否存在其他构造也能实现最优误差。

Method: 通过理论证明，分析协议与平衡不完全区组设计的关系。

Result: 任何实现最优误差的协议必须对应于平衡不完全区组设计。

Conclusion: 最优误差和最优通信的协议仅基于对称平衡不完全区组设计。

Abstract: Local differential privacy represents the gold standard for preserving the
privacy of data before it leaves the device, and distribution estimation under
this model has been well studied. Recently, protocols built upon balanced
incomplete block designs were shown to achieve optimal error for this problem.
However, it remained unknown whether other constructions could also be optimal.
We resolve this question by proving that any protocol achieving optimal error
must correspond to some balanced incomplete block design. This result, combined
with prior work, completely characterises the set of optimal protocols for this
problem. As a consequence, the protocols that achieve optimal error and optimal
communication are only those based on symmetrical balanced incomplete block
designs.

### [5] [Neural Estimation of Information Leakage for Secure Communication System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05176)
*Darius S. Heerklotz,Ingo Schroeder,Pin-Hsun Lin,Christian Deppe,Eduard A. Jorswieck*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的互信息估计器，用于量化通信系统中的信息泄漏，并扩展了块长度以支持更复杂的处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低估泄漏会损害保密性，而高估则导致系统设计低效，因此需要可靠的泄漏估计器。

Method: 基于变分对比对数比上界框架，提出改进的互信息估计器，适用于离散和连续变量，并结合神经网络参数化的伯努利专家混合模型。

Result: 仿真显示，先前方法显著低估互信息，尤其在较高块长度时；新方法可将块长度扩展至255，并推测可进一步扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的估计器和自适应哈希设计框架为有限块长度下的物理层安全提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Underestimating the leakage can compromise secrecy, while overestimating it
may lead to inefficient system design. Therefore, a reliable leakage estimator
is essential. Neural network-based estimators provide a data-driven way to
estimate mutual information without requiring full knowledge of the channel or
source distributions. In this work, we aim to scale the blocklength of a
wiretap code such that the estimator can still feasibly operate. We propose an
improved mutual information estimator based on the variational contrastive
log-ration upper bound framework, tailored for both discrete and continuous
variables. By using a mixture of Bernoulli experts parameterized by neural
networks, the estimator is able to quantify information leakage in
communication systems, which employ complex data processing like universal hash
family. We further propose a method to utilize the proposed estimator to design
the universal hash family for a wiretap code or secret key generation design.
Simulation results show thatprior methods significantly underestimate the
mutual information, particularly when using universal hash family for higher
blocklengths ($n\gg$16). The proposed method can scale the blocklength up to
255, and we conjecture that the design can scale well to even higher
blocklengths given adequate training data and model size. Additionally, we
contend that our proposed estimator and adaptive hash design framework offer a
practical approach for extending physical layer security considerations for
wiretap channels into the finite blocklength regime.

### [6] [Simultaneous Rational Function Codes: Improved Analysis Beyond Half the Minimum Distance with Multiplicities and Poles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05284)
*Matteo Abbondati,Eleonora Guerrini,Romain Lebreton*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Abbondati等人（2024）关于解码同时有理函数码的工作，解决了多重性和极点（分母的零点）两种重要场景。通过多精度评估，将结果推广到具有多重性的有理码；并利用Guerrini等人（2023）的混合模型，扩展到可能具有极点的有理函数向量。贡献包括：解码算法失败概率的严格分析、扩展到混合模型以处理非随机错误的情况，以及在更一般背景下处理极点和多重性的改进分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决有理函数码解码中的多重性和极点问题，以提升错误纠正能力。

Method: 1. 通过多精度评估推广到具有多重性的有理码；2. 利用混合模型扩展到可能具有极点的有理函数向量。

Result: 提供了解码算法失败概率的严格分析，扩展了混合模型，改进了极点和多重性背景下的分析。

Conclusion: 理论结果为更复杂场景下的重建失败提供了全面的概率分析，推动了有理函数码错误纠正技术的进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Abbondati et al. (2024) on decoding
simultaneous rational function codes by addressing two important scenarios:
multiplicities and poles (zeros of denominators). First, we generalize previous
results to rational codes with multiplicities by considering evaluations with
multi-precision. Then, using the hybrid model from Guerrini et al. (2023), we
extend our approach to vectors of rational functions that may present poles.
Our contributions include: a rigorous analysis of the decoding algorithm's
failure probability that generalizes and improves several previous results, an
extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be
assumed random, and a new improved analysis in the more general context
handling poles within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a
comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more
complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for
rational function codes.

### [7] [Fundamental limit of Sum Capacity in Pinching Antenna Assisted Multiple Access Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05309)
*Guangji Chen,Qingqing Wu,Kangda Zhi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究了PASS辅助多址信道的总容量极限，揭示了动态pinching波束成形在理想情况下的最优传输方案，并推导了上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PASS系统通过动态pinching波束成形灵活配置无线信道的潜力，特别是在多用户场景下的总容量极限。

Method: 采用动态pinching波束成形和NOMA传输方案，分析理想情况下（无限pinching波束成形向量）的最优传输策略，并推导上下界。

Result: 理想情况下，最优传输方案是用户交替传输，无需NOMA；推导了总容量的闭式上界和有限pinching波束成形向量下的下界。

Conclusion: 动态pinching波束成形可显著提升总容量，数值结果验证了理论发现的实际意义。

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASSs) have recently shown their promising ability
to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the
positions of pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching
beamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum capacity for a
PASSassisted multiple access channel, in which multiple users transmit
individual messages to a BS under the average power constraint. To this end, we
consider a dynamic pinching beamforming setup, where multiple pinching
beamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the
capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission
scheme is considered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of
pinching beamforming vectors, we unveil that the optimal transmission scheme is
alternating transmission among each user with its channel power gain maximized
by dynamic pinching beamforming, which implies that the NOMA-based transmission
scheme is not needed. The corresponding sum-rate is derived in closed-form
expression, which serves as the upper bound of the sum-capacity. Inspired by
this result, a lower bound of the sum-rate under an arbitrarily finite number
of pinching beamforming vectors is obtained. Numerical results validate our
theoretical findings and illustrate the practical significance of using dynamic
pinching beamforming to improve the sum capacity.

### [8] [$\mathbb{F}_{2}\mathbb{F}_{4}$-Additive Complementary Dual Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05317)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索混合字母表$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$上的ACD码的性质及其与二进制LCD码的关系，以扩展编码理论的应用范围。

Method: 定义了$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$上的内积，并建立了ACD码的充分条件；通过线性映射$W$将ACD码转化为二进制LCD码。

Result: 证明了ACD码的二进制图像为LCD码时，原码必为ACD码，并给出了一个距离最优的二进制LCD码实例。

Conclusion: ACD码在混合字母表上的研究为构造二进制LCD码提供了新方法，且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure and properties of additive
complementary dual (ACD) codes over the mixed alphabet
$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$ relative to a certain inner product defined over
$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$. We establish sufficient conditions under which such
codes are additive complementary dual (ACD) codes. We also show that ACD codes
over $\mathbb{F}_{2}\mathbb{F}_{4}$ can be applied to construct binary linear
complementary dual codes as their images under the linear map $W$. Notably, we
prove that if the binary image of a code is LCD, then the original code is
necessarily ACD. An example is given where the image is a distance-optimal
binary LCD code.

### [9] [On the entropy growth of sums of iid discrete random variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05348)
*Riccardo Castellano,Pavel Sekatski*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文推导了N个独立同分布离散随机变量和的Shannon熵的渐近下界，提出了一个称为不相容秩的新概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究离散随机变量和的熵的下界，特别是通过引入不相容秩这一概念，以更一般化的方式描述熵的行为。

Method: 基于多项分布和格点随机变量和的已知渐近熵表达式，不依赖中心极限定理，推导出一般情况下的下界。

Result: 得到熵的下界为H ≥ (r(X)/2)log(N) + cst，其中r(X)为不相容秩。

Conclusion: 通过引入不相容秩，为离散随机变量和的熵提供了更普适的渐近下界。

Abstract: We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the Shannon entropy $H$ of sums of $N$
arbitrary iid discrete random variables. The derived bound $H \geq
\frac{r(X)}{2}\log(N) + {\it cst}$ is given in terms of the incommensurability
rank $r(X)$ of the random variable -- a positive integer quantity that we
introduce. The derivation does not rely on central limit theorems, but builds
upon the known expressions of the asymptotic entropy of the multinomial
distribution and sums of iid lattice random variables, which correspond to the
case $r(X)=1$.

### [10] [Communication-Efficient Distributed Computing Through Combinatorial Multi-Access Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05426)
*Shanuja Sasi,Onur Günlü*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多接入分布式计算（MADC）模型，利用组合设计（t-designs）构建高效编码方案，显著减少计算节点数量，但通信成本增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MapReduce框架需要文件复制，导致通信开销大。MADC通过编码理论技术减少通信开销，无需文件复制。

Method: 利用组合设计（t-designs）构建编码方案，连接t-designs与MapReduce数组，优化计算负载为1。

Result: 提出的方案显著减少了计算节点数量，但通信成本增加。

Conclusion: MADC模型通过组合设计实现了高效的分布式计算，尽管通信成本有所增加，但在计算节点优化方面表现优异。

Abstract: This paper explores the multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model, a
novel distributed computing framework where mapper and reducer nodes are
distinct entities. Unlike traditional MapReduce frameworks, MADC leverages
coding-theoretic techniques to minimize communication overhead without
necessitating file replication across mapper nodes. We introduce a new approach
utilizing combinatorial designs, specifically t-designs, to construct efficient
coding schemes that achieve a computation load of 1. By establishing a
connection between t-designs and MapReduce Arrays, we characterize the
achievable communication loads and demonstrate the flexibility of our method in
selecting the number of reducer nodes. The proposed scheme significantly
reduces the number of reducer nodes relative to existing combinatorial topology
schemes, at the expense of increased communication cost.

### [11] [Long Polar vs. LDPC Codes under Complexity-Constrained Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05485)
*Felix Krieg,Marvin Rübenacke,Andreas Zunker,Stephan ten Brink*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 长极化码在有限迭代次数下表现优于LDPC码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行业和学术界普遍认为极化码在短码长下具有竞争力，但在长码长下无法与LDPC码匹敌。本文挑战这一观点，指出实际应用中迭代次数受限，极化码可能更优。

Method: 比较极化码（采用SC和SSC解码）与LDPC码（采用BP解码）在相同固定点LLR操作下的性能。

Result: 长极化码在SC解码下表现优于LDPC码；SSC解码的复杂度优于N logN，且操作数少于单次BP迭代。

Conclusion: 在有限迭代条件下，极化码是长码长下的更优选择。

Abstract: The prevailing opinion in industry and academia is that polar codes are
competitive for short code lengths, but can no longer keep up with low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes as block length increases. This view is typically
based on the assumption that LDPC codes can be decoded with a large number of
belief propagation (BP) iterations. However, in practice, the number of
iterations may be rather limited due to latency and complexity constraints. In
this paper, we show that for a similar number of fixed-point log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) operations, long polar codes under successive cancellation (SC)
decoding outperform their LDPC counterparts. In particular, simplified
successive cancellation (SSC) decoding of polar codes exhibits a better
complexity scaling than $N \log{N}$ and requires fewer operations than a single
BP iteration of an LDPC code with the same parameters.

### [12] [Multivariate Partial Information Decomposition: Constructions, Inconsistencies, and Alternative Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05530)
*Aobo Lyu,Andrew Clark,Netanel Raviv*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多元系统中信息分解的局限性，提出了一种新的方法来测量多元独特和协同信息，并证明了传统PID框架在三个或更多源变量时的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统互信息无法捕捉多元系统中的复杂交互，PID框架虽能分解信息，但在多源情况下存在不一致性。

Method: 通过提供两源PID的闭式解、证明多源PID的不一致性，并提出新的多元信息测量方法。

Result: 两源PID问题得到解决，但多源PID存在根本性矛盾；新方法在Ising模型实验中表现良好。

Conclusion: 需要新的框架来研究多元信息分解，以克服PID的局限性。

Abstract: While mutual information effectively quantifies dependence between two
variables, it cannot capture complex, fine-grained interactions that emerge in
multivariate systems.The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework was
introduced to address this by decomposing the mutual information between a set
of source variables and a target variable into fine-grained information atoms
such as redundant, unique, and synergistic components. In this work, we review
the axiomatic system and desired properties of the PID framework and make three
main contributions. First, we resolve the two-source PID case by providing
explicit closed-form formulas for all information atoms that satisfy the full
set of axioms and desirable properties. Second, we prove that for three or more
sources, PID suffers from fundamental inconsistencies: we present a
three-variable counterexample where the sum of atoms exceeds the total
information, and prove an impossibility theorem showing that no lattice-based
decomposition can be consistent for all subsets when the number of sources
exceeds three. Finally, we deviate from the PID lattice approach to avoid its
inconsistencies, and present explicit measures of multivariate unique and
synergistic information. Our proposed measures, which rely on new systems of
random variables that eliminate higher-order dependencies, satisfy key axioms
such as additivity and continuity, provide a robust theoretical explanation of
high-order relations, and show strong numerical performance in comprehensive
experiments on the Ising model. Our findings highlight the need for a new
framework for studying multivariate information decomposition.

*Yiyang Chen,Wenchao Liu,Chunjie Wang,Yinyu Wu,Xuhui Zhang,Yanyan Shen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于自主飞行器（AAV）的集成感知、通信和计算系统，通过引入可移动天线（MAs）提升性能，提出了一种优化算法以减少延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过集成可移动天线（MAs）到AAV系统中，提升感知、通信和计算的整体性能，解决多任务协同的资源分配问题。

Method: 提出了一种双层迭代算法，结合粒子群优化和凸优化，联合优化MAs位置、计算资源分配和传输波束成形。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方案在延迟性能上显著优于基线方案。

Conclusion: 通过优化MAs位置和资源分配，显著降低了系统延迟，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated
sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on
integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

### [14] [Neural Field-Based 3D Surface Reconstruction of Microstructures from Multi-Detector Signals in Scanning Electron Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04728)
*Shuo Chen,Yijin Li,Xi Zheng,Guofeng Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: NFH-SEM是一种基于神经场的混合SEM 3D重建方法，通过多视角、多探测器2D SEM图像输入，结合几何和光度信息，实现复杂微结构的精确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统2D SEM图像无法直接显示3D形貌，现有方法因离散3D表示、标定需求和阴影梯度误差而受限。

Method: NFH-SEM采用神经场表示，通过端到端自标定和自动阴影分离，无需手动标定。

Result: 在真实和模拟数据集上验证，成功重建复杂微结构（如双光子光刻微结构、桃花花粉等），细节精确。

Conclusion: NFH-SEM具有高保真度和广泛适用性，解决了复杂微结构重建的挑战。

Abstract: The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a widely used imaging device in
scientific research and industrial applications. Conventional two-dimensional
(2D) SEM images do not directly reveal the three-dimensional (3D) topography of
micro samples, motivating the development of SEM 3D surface reconstruction
methods. However, reconstruction of complex microstructures remains challenging
for existing methods due to the limitations of discrete 3D representations, the
need for calibration with reference samples, and shadow-induced gradient
errors. Here, we introduce NFH-SEM, a neural field-based hybrid SEM 3D
reconstruction method that takes multi-view, multi-detector 2D SEM images as
input and fuses geometric and photometric information into a continuous neural
field representation. NFH-SEM eliminates the manual calibration procedures
through end-to-end self-calibration and automatically disentangles shadows from
SEM images during training, enabling accurate reconstruction of intricate
microstructures. We validate the effectiveness of NFH-SEM on real and simulated
datasets. Our experiments show high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse,
challenging samples, including two-photon lithography microstructures, peach
pollen, and silicon carbide particle surfaces, demonstrating precise detail and
broad applicability.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何引导的超分辨率模型，用于融合Sentinel-2的10米和20米波段，通过聚类学习和多注意力机制提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentinel-2的10米波段提供精细结构，20米波段提供丰富光谱信息，融合两者可提升图像质量。

Method: 采用聚类学习生成几何引导图像，结合展开的反投影架构和多头注意力机制，建模非局部块交互。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在超分辨率和融合任务上优于传统和深度学习技术。

Conclusion: 几何引导和多注意力机制有效提升了图像融合质量，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: The Sentinel-2 mission provides multispectral imagery with 13 bands at
resolutions of 10m, 20m, and 60m. In particular, the 10m bands offer fine
structural detail, while the 20m bands capture richer spectral information. In
this paper, we propose a geometry-guided super-resolution model for fusing the
10m and 20m bands. Our approach introduces a cluster-based learning procedure
to generate a geometry-rich guiding image from the 10m bands. This image is
integrated into an unfolded back-projection architecture that leverages image
self-similarities through a multi-head attention mechanism, which models
nonlocal patch-based interactions across spatial and spectral dimensions. We
also generate a dataset for evaluation, comprising three testing sets that
include urban, rural, and coastal landscapes. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms both classical and deep learning-based
super-resolution and fusion techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学图像检索方法在样本量、数据分割和统计验证方面的局限性，以支持临床诊断和质量保证。

Method: 采用DenseNet121、ResNet50和VGG16等CNN架构，结合精细调优、度量学习和超集成优化策略，使用分层数据分割和bootstrap置信区间进行验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为5类医学检索任务设定了新的性能基准，并为临床部署提供了基于证据的架构选择指南。

Abstract: Content-based mammographic image retrieval systems require exact BIRADS
categorical matching across five distinct classes, presenting significantly
greater complexity than binary classification tasks commonly addressed in
literature. Current medical image retrieval studies suffer from methodological
limitations including inadequate sample sizes, improper data splitting, and
insufficient statistical validation that hinder clinical translation. We
developed a comprehensive evaluation framework systematically comparing CNN
architectures (DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16) with advanced training strategies
including sophisticated fine-tuning, metric learning, and super-ensemble
optimization. Our evaluation employed rigorous stratified data splitting
(50%/20%/30% train/validation/test), 602 test queries, and systematic
validation using bootstrap confidence intervals with 1,000 samples. Advanced
fine-tuning with differential learning rates achieved substantial improvements:
DenseNet121 (34.79% precision@10, 19.64% improvement) and ResNet50 (34.54%,
19.58% improvement). Super-ensemble optimization combining complementary
architectures achieved 36.33% precision@10 (95% CI: [34.78%, 37.88%]),
representing 24.93% improvement over baseline and providing 3.6 relevant cases
per query. Statistical analysis revealed significant performance differences
between optimization strategies (p<0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's
d>0.8), while maintaining practical search efficiency (2.8milliseconds).
Performance significantly exceeds realistic expectations for 5-class medical
retrieval tasks, where literature suggests 20-25% precision@10 represents
achievable performance for exact BIRADS matching. Our framework establishes new

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems are commonly addressed by minimizing measurement
consistency and signal prior terms. While huge attention has been paid to
developing high-performance priors, even the most advanced signal prior may
lose its effectiveness when paired with an ill-conditioned sensing matrix that
hinders convergence and degrades reconstruction quality. In optimization
theory, preconditioners allow improving the algorithm's convergence by
transforming the gradient update. Traditional linear preconditioning techniques
enhance convergence, but their performance remains limited due to their
dependence on the structure of the sensing matrix. Learning-based linear
preconditioners have been proposed, but they are optimized only for
data-fidelity optimization, which may lead to solutions in the null-space of
the sensing matrix. This paper employs knowledge distillation to design a
nonlinear preconditioning operator. In our method, a teacher algorithm using a
better-conditioned (synthetic) sensing matrix guides the student algorithm with
an ill-conditioned sensing matrix through gradient matching via a
preconditioning neural network. We validate our nonlinear preconditioner for
plug-and-play FISTA in single-pixel, magnetic resonance, and super-resolution
imaging tasks, showing consistent performance improvements and better empirical
convergence.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯混合模型（GMM）的cryoGS方法，用于直接从原始冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）图像中重建分子结构，无需依赖外部初始化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）在结构生物学中至关重要，但现有方法依赖外部共识图或原子模型初始化，限制了其独立应用。

Method: cryoGS结合高斯溅射和冷冻电镜成像物理，开发了正交投影感知的高斯溅射技术，并引入归一化项和FFT对齐坐标系。

Result: 实验证明cryoGS在真实数据集上比基线方法更有效和稳健。

Conclusion: cryoGS为冷冻电镜重建提供了一种稳定且高效的独立解决方案。

Abstract: As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy
(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at
near-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM
is to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large
collection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian
mixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically
interpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained
interest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external
consensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in
self-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a
GMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM
image formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware
Gaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and
FFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging. All these
innovations enable stable and efficient homogeneous reconstruction directly
from raw cryo-EM particle images using random initialization. Experimental
results on real datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of cryoGS
over representative baselines. The code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: AI-powered medical devices have driven the need for real-time, on-device
inference such as biomedical image classification. Deployment of deep learning
models at the edge is now used for applications such as anomaly detection and
classification in medical images. However, achieving this level of performance
on edge devices remains challenging due to limitations in model size and
computational capacity. To address this, we present MedMambaLite, a
hardware-aware Mamba-based model optimized through knowledge distillation for
medical image classification. We start with a powerful MedMamba model,
integrating a Mamba structure for efficient feature extraction in medical
imaging. We make the model lighter and faster in training and inference by
modifying and reducing the redundancies in the architecture. We then distill
its knowledge into a smaller student model by reducing the embedding
dimensions. The optimized model achieves 94.5% overall accuracy on 10 MedMNIST
datasets. It also reduces parameters 22.8x compared to MedMamba. Deployment on
an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano achieves 35.6 GOPS/J energy per inference. This
outperforms MedMamba by 63% improvement in energy per inference.

Method: 利用INRs提供紧凑连续的图像表示，结合深度权重空间网络、图神经网络和关系注意力变换器进行质量评估。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上验证了方法的有效性，性能相当但参数更少。

Conclusion: INRs为医学图像质量评估提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Artifacts pose a significant challenge in medical imaging, impacting
diagnostic accuracy and downstream analysis. While image-based approaches for
detecting artifacts can be effective, they often rely on preprocessing methods
that can lead to information loss and high-memory-demand medical images,
thereby limiting the scalability of classification models. In this work, we
propose the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) for image quality
assessment. INRs provide a compact and continuous representation of medical
images, naturally handling variations in resolution and image size while
reducing memory overhead. We develop deep weight space networks, graph neural
networks, and relational attention transformers that operate on INRs to achieve
image quality assessment. Our method is evaluated on the ACDC dataset with
synthetically generated artifact patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
assessing image quality while achieving similar performance with fewer
parameters.

Motivation: 解决Spitz肿瘤与常规黑色素瘤在组织学特征上的重叠问题，探索AI在诊断和预测中的潜力。

Method: 使用393例Spitz肿瘤和379例常规黑色素瘤数据集开发并验证AI模型，比较其与四位病理学家的表现，并进行模拟实验评估AI对工作流程的影响。

Result: AI模型在区分任务中表现优异，预测基因异常和诊断类别的准确率分别为0.55和0.51，优于随机猜测。模拟实验显示AI可降低成本和时间。

Conclusion: AI模型在Spitz肿瘤诊断中表现良好，尤其在区分任务中，但在预测基因异常和诊断类别上仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Spitz tumors are diagnostically challenging due to overlap in atypical
histological features with conventional melanomas. We investigated to what
extent AI models, using histological and/or clinical features, can: (1)
distinguish Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas; (2) predict the
underlying genetic aberration of Spitz tumors; and (3) predict the diagnostic
category of Spitz tumors. The AI models were developed and validated using a
dataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive
performance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of
the AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a
reader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate
the impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic
testing on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on
UNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in
differentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic
aberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly
guessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where
random chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models
performed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not
statistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the
simulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary
diagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and
examinations. In conclusion, the AI models achieved a strong predictive
performance in distinguishing between Spitz tumors and conventional melanomas.
On the more challenging tasks of predicting the genetic aberration and the
diagnostic category of Spitz tumors, the AI models performed better than random
chance.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR)-to-computed tomography (CT) translation offers
significant advantages, including the elimination of radiation exposure
associated with CT scans and the mitigation of imaging artifacts caused by
patient motion. The existing approaches are based on single-modality MR-to-CT
translation, with limited research exploring multimodal fusion. To address this
limitation, we introduce Multi-modal MR to CT (MM2CT) translation method by
leveraging multimodal T1- and T2-weighted MRI data, an innovative Mamba-based
framework for multi-modal medical image synthesis. Mamba effectively overcomes
the limited local receptive field in CNNs and the high computational complexity
issues in Transformers. MM2CT leverages this advantage to maintain long-range
dependencies modeling capabilities while achieving multi-modal MR feature
integration. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic local convolution module
and a dynamic enhancement module to improve MRI-to-CT synthesis. The
experiments on a public pelvis dataset demonstrate that MM2CT achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 这些波形无关的算法易于集成到现有软件定义无线电系统中，为雷达信号处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric
distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required
radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions
are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks
which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of
system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems,
real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using
non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an
analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary
waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations
for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically
using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as
execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations
for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for
dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a
numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion.
Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in
accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed
in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic
and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making
them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.

Abstract: The utilization of radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless sensing has
garnered increasing attention. However, the radio environment is unpredictable
and often unfavorable, the sensing accuracy of traditional RF sensing methods
is often affected by adverse propagation channels from the transmitter to the
receiver, such as fading and noise. In this paper, we propose employing
distributed Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA) to detect
the presence and location of objects where multiple RIMSA receivers (RIMSA Rxs)
are deployed on different places. By programming their beamforming patterns,
RIMSA Rxs can enhance the quality of received signals. The RF sensing problem
is modeled as a joint optimization problem of beamforming pattern and mapping
of received signals to sensing outcomes. To address this challenge, we
introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm aimed at calculating
the optimal beamforming patterns and a neural network aimed at converting
received signals into sensing outcomes. In addition, the malicious attacker may
potentially launch jamming attack to disrupt sensing process. To enable
effective sensing in interferenceprone environment, we devise a combined loss
function that takes into account the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio
(SINR) of the received signals. The simulation results show that the proposed
distributed RIMSA system can achieve more efficient sensing performance and
better overcome environmental influences than centralized implementation.
Furthermore, the introduced method ensures high-accuracy sensing performance
even under jamming attack.

Conclusion: 基于局部核的方法在噪声条件下具有鲁棒性和高效性，未来可扩展至非线性啁啾和自适应核设计。

Abstract: This dissertation presents two signal processing methods using specially
designed localized kernels for parameter recovery under noisy condition. The
first method addresses the estimation of frequencies and amplitudes in
multidimensional exponential models. It utilizes localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels to detect the multivariate frequencies, followed by a more
detailed parameter estimation. We compare our method with MUSIC and ESPRIT,
which are classical subspace-based algorithms widely used for estimating the
parameters of exponential signals. In the univariate case, the method
outperforms MUSIC and ESPRIT under low signal-to-noise ratios. For the
multivariate case, we develop a coordinate-wise projection and registration
approach that achieves high recovery accuracy using significantly fewer samples
than other methods.
  The second method focuses on separating linear chirp components from
time-localized signal segments. A variant of the Signal Separation Operator
(SSO) is constructed using a localized kernel. Instantaneous frequency
estimates are obtained via FFT-based filtering, then clustered and fitted with
piecewise linear regression. The method operates without prior knowledge of the
number of components and is shown to recover intersecting and discontinuous
chirps at SNR levels as low as -30 dB.
  Both methods share an idea based on localized kernels and efficient FFT-based
implementation, and neither requires subspace decomposition or sparsity
regularization. Experimental results confirm the robustness and tractability of
the proposed approaches across a range of simulated data conditions. Potential
extensions include application to nonlinear chirps, adaptive kernel design, and
signal classification using extracted features.

Abstract: To utilize the full potential of the available power at a base station (BS),
we propose a joint precoding, antenna selection, and transmit power control
algorithm for a total power budget at the BS. We formulate a sum spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem for downlink multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems with
arbitrary-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs). We reformulate the
problem by defining the ergodic sum SE using the conditional average rate
approach to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT), and by using approximation techniques to make the problem more
tractable. Then, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
control subproblems. We solve the precoding direction subproblem by identifying
a superior Lagrangian stationary point, and the power control subproblem using
gradient descent. We also propose a complexity-reduction approach that is more
suitable for massive MIMO systems. Simulation results not only validate the
proposed algorithm but also reveal that when utilizing the full potential of
the power budget at the BS, medium-resolution DACs with 8-11 bits may actually
be more power-efficient than low-resolution DACs.

Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the
sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios,
sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC)
techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this
paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (EB)-aided
partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (EB-P2WCP)
for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, EB is
utilized to characterize the static properties of the electromagnetic
environment, which is extracted from the digital twin map, serving as
environmental information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse EB with
real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain
channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an EB-based
partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (EB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a
robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation
results indicate that incorporating EB provides significant benefits under low
signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up
to 50% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains
robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization
errors with only a 0.5 dB NMSE increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel
coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.

Conclusion: 基于液体透镜的系统在动态条件下优于传统静态透镜接收器，显著提升了误码率性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a liquid lens-based imaging receiver is proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC)
systems. By dynamically adjusting the focal length and orientation angles of
the liquid lens, the spatial correlation between MIMO channel gains is reduced,
leading to enhanced bit-error rate (BER) performance. Unlike static lenses,
liquid lenses offer adaptability in dynamic conditions, including user mobility
and random receiver orientation. An accurate mathematical framework is
developed to model the channel gains of the proposed system, and an
optimization problem is formulated to minimize its BER. Due to the complexity
of the resulting channel model, two lens adjustment schemes, namely, ($i$) the
CLS scheme, and ($ii$) the VULO scheme are introduced. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed liquid lens-based system offers substantial BER
improvements over conventional static lens-based receivers across a wide range
of random receiver orientation conditions. Specifically, at a random receiver
orientation variance of $10^{\circ}$, the BER is improved from $4\times
10^{-2}$ to $5\times 10^{-4}$ by employing the proposed liquid lens.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) technology plays a critical role
in future intelligent transportation systems, by enabling vehicles to perceive
and reconstruct the surrounding environment through reuse of wireless signals,
thereby reducing or even eliminating the need for additional sensors such as
LiDAR or radar. However, existing ISAC based reconstruction methods often lack
the ability to track dynamic scenes with sufficient accuracy and temporal
consistency, limiting the real world applicability. To address this limitation,
we propose a deep learning based framework for vehicular environment
reconstruction by using ISAC channels. We first establish a joint channel
environment dataset based on multi modal measurements from real world urban
street scenarios. Then, a multistage deep learning network is developed to
reconstruct the environment. Specifically, a scene decoder identifies the
environmental context such as buildings, trees and so on; a cluster center
decoder predicts coarse spatial layouts by localizing dominant scattering
centers; a point cloud decoder recovers fine grained geometry and structure of
surrounding environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high-quality dynamic environment reconstruction with a Chamfer
Distance of 0.29 and F Score@1% of 0.87. In addition, complexity analysis
demonstrates the efficiency and practical applicability of the method in real
time scenarios. This work provides a pathway toward low cost environment
reconstruction based on ISAC for future intelligent transportation.

Method: 使用瞬时时间-频率原子，将信号分析（如时域、频域、分数傅里叶变换等）视为AM-FM分量的分解，并利用二次chirplet模板进行统一。

Result: 通过闭式表达式计算了多种信号分析的IS，并将其组织为一个二维连续体。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将多种信号分析统一为一个框架，并通过实例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In previous work, we presented a general framework for instantaneous
time-frequency analysis but did not provide any specific details of how to
compute a particular instantaneous spectrum (IS). In this work, we use
instantaneous time-frequency atoms to obtain an IS associated with common
signal analyses: time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, fractional
Fourier transform, synchrosqueezed short-time Fourier transform, and
synchrosqueezed short-time fractional Fourier transform. By doing so, we
demonstrate how the general framework can be used to unify these analyses and
we develop closed-form expressions for the corresponding ISs. This is
accomplished by viewing these analyses as decompositions into AM--FM components
and recognizing that each uses a specialized (or limiting) form of a quadratic
chirplet as a template during analysis. With a two-parameter quadratic
chirplet, we can organize these ISs into a 2D continuum with points in the
plane corresponding to a decomposition related to one of the signal analyses.
Finally, using several example signals, we compute in closed-form the ISs for
the various analyses.

Abstract: In this paper, a sub-uW power 802.11b backscattering transmitter is presented
to enable reuse of the same incident wave for three purposes: RF harvesting,
backscattering communications and position/motion sensing. The removal of the
battery and any off-chip motion sensor (e.g., MEMS) enables unprecedented level
of miniaturization and ubiquity, unrestricted device lifespan, low fabrication
and maintenance cost. The uW power wall for WiFi transmitters is broken for the
first time via local oscillator elimination, as achieved by extracting its
frequency through second-order intermodulation of a twotone incident wave. The
two-tone scheme also enables a cumulative harvesting/transmission/sensing
sensitivity down to Pmin -19 dBm. Position/motion sensing is enabled by using
the harvested voltage as a proxy for the Received Signal Strength (RSS),
allowing to sense the chip location with respect to the tone generator(s)
shared across tags in indoor neighborhoods.

Conclusion: 所提出的四级OTA设计在简化补偿和提高功率效率方面具有显著优势，适用于超低功耗应用。

Abstract: A four-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) for ultra-low-power
applications is introduced in this paper. The proposed circuit inclusive of
frequency compensation requires minimal transistor count and passives,
overcoming the traditionally difficult compensation of 4-stage OTAs and
bringing it back to the simplicity of 3-stage OTAs. At the same time, the
proposed circuit achieves high power efficiency, as evidenced by the >3.7X
(>11.3X) improvement in the large-signal (small-signal) power efficiency figure
of merit FOML (FOMS), compared to prior 4-stage OTAs (sub-1 V multi-stage
OTAs). Thanks to the lower sensitivity of the phase margin to the load
capacitance, the proposed OTA remains stable under a wide range of loads
(double-sided as in any 3-4-stage OTA), achieving a max/min ratio of the load
capacitance of >100X.
