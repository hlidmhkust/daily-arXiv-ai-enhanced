### [1] [Dynamic Exponent Market Maker: Personalized Portfolio Manager and One Pool to Trade Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22732)
*Wittawat Kositwattanarerk*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一种新型AMM协议，允许流动性提供者以任意比例存入代币，并通过动态不变函数实现单一池交易，但需防范闪电贷攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有去中心化交易所（如Uniswap、Balancer）中流动性提供需特定比例代币及交易需跨池跳转的问题。

Method: 设计动态不变函数的AMM协议，支持任意比例代币存入，并保持总价值比例。

Result: 实现单一池内所有交易对操作，减少交易费用和Gas费用。

Conclusion: 该协议有效简化流动性提供和交易流程，但需配合防范措施以避免闪电贷攻击。

Abstract: Decentralized exchange platforms such as Uniswap and Balancer operate on
several pools where each pool contains two or more cryptocurrencies and
constitutes direct trading pairs. The drawbacks here are that liquidity
providing requires contribution of tokens in a specific proportion, and trading
may require hopping between pools, hence increasing transaction fee and gas
fee. We propose an automated market maker (AMM) protocol where liquidity
providers can deposit any amount of tokens into the pool. The protocol will
preserve the proportion of tokens by total value at the time of deposit and can
be seen as a personalized self-balancing portfolio manager. In addition, since
the invariant function is dynamic, all exchange pairs are executed from a
single composite pool. Nevertheless, the scheme is vulnerable to flash loan
attacks and must be used in conjunction with preventive measures.

### [2] [Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865)
*Sahan Liyanaarachchi,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种优化马尔可夫机器（MM）利用率的方法，目标是最大化其平均收益，通过阈值或切换策略实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工厂时代的到来，高效跟踪和利用计算资源变得至关重要。现有研究多关注跟踪MM状态，而忽略了如何优化其利用。

Method: 假设泊松作业到达过程和基于查询的采样方法，研究如何最优提交作业以最大化单位作业的平均收益。

Result: 根据MM参数，最优策略表现为阈值策略或基于状态估计年龄的切换策略。

Conclusion: 优化MM利用的策略能显著提升其收益，为资源管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy,
development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available
computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources
are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy
states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are
commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely
focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a
rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key
observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize
it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM,
where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM.
Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to
sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available
jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We
show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the
form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on
the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.

### [3] [A Segmentation Framework for Accurate Diagnosis of Amyloid Positivity without Structural Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22336)
*Penghan Zhu,Shurui Mei,Shushan Chen,Xiaobo Chu,Shanbo He,Ziyi Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，仅使用PET图像实现脑区分割和淀粉样蛋白阳性分类，无需结构MRI或CT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对结构成像的依赖，简化临床和研究中的分析流程。

Method: 采用四层深度的3D U-Net架构，在200个F18-florbetapir淀粉样蛋白PET扫描数据集上进行训练和验证。

Result: 分割性能Dice系数为0.45-0.88，分类准确率为0.98，AUC为0.99。

Conclusion: 该模型有望整合到仅依赖PET的诊断流程中，未来将扩展至其他PET示踪剂。

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automated
segmentation of brain regions and classification of amyloid positivity using
positron emission tomography (PET) images alone, without the need for
structural MRI or CT. A 3D U-Net architecture with four layers of depth was
trained and validated on a dataset of 200 F18-florbetapir amyloid-PET scans,
with an 130/20/50 train/validation/test split. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients across 30 brain regions, with
scores ranging from 0.45 to 0.88, demonstrating high anatomical accuracy,
particularly in subcortical structures. Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake
within clinically relevant regions. Precuneus, prefrontal cortex, gyrus rectus,
and lateral temporal cortex was assessed using normalized root mean square
error, achieving values as low as 0.0011. Furthermore, the model achieved a
classification accuracy of 0.98 for amyloid positivity based on regional uptake
quantification, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.99. These results
highlight the model's potential for integration into PET only diagnostic
pipelines, particularly in settings where structural imaging is not available.
This approach reduces dependence on coregistration and manual delineation,
enabling scalable, reliable, and reproducible analysis in clinical and research
applications. Future work will focus on clinical validation and extension to
diverse PET tracers including C11 PiB and other F18 labeled compounds.

### [4] [Whole-brain Transferable Representations from Large-Scale fMRI Data Improve Task-Evoked Brain Activity Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22378)
*Yueh-Po Peng,Vincent K. M. Cheung,Li Su*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: STDA-SwiFT模型通过空间-时间分割注意力和自监督对比学习，利用大规模fMRI数据集提升任务诱发活动的解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI数据解码的高维度、低信噪比和有限数据问题。

Method: 基于Transformer的STDA-SwiFT模型，结合空间-时间分割注意力和自监督对比学习。

Result: 模型显著提升多感官和认知领域的任务诱发活动解码性能。

Conclusion: 迁移学习是克服fMRI数据解码挑战的有效方法。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to decode mental states from brain
activity. While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial
precision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity --
remains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio,
and limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer
vision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns
transferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via
spatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.
Using pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human
Connectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves
downstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory
and cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate
performance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient
attention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in
pretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples. Our work showcases transfer
learning as a viable approach to harness large-scale datasets to overcome
challenges in decoding brain activity from fMRI data.

### [5] [Towards Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via a Visual Foundation Model-driven Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22481)
*Tianyi Liu,Kejun Wu,Chen Cai,Yi Wang,Kim-Hui Yap,Lap-Pui Chau*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需人工标注的盲视频恢复框架，结合视觉基础模型和恢复模型，显著提升了视频恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频信号在传输和存储中易受损坏，现有方法需要人工标注损坏区域且恢复效果有限。

Method: 提出DAC模型和CFC模块，利用视觉基础模型和残差专家结构进行自适应恢复。

Result: 在无需人工标注的情况下，实现了出色的视频恢复性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了用户体验和应用场景的可靠性。

Abstract: Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,
as even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain
degradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,
bitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and
understudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and
labor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,
resulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery
remains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames
may mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,
we propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that
integrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to
different types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the
framework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich
priors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and
corruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.
Additionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)
module, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level
corruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and
high-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our
method suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in
bitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask
sequence. The demonstrated effectiveness will help to realize improved user
experience, wider application scenarios, and more reliable multimedia
communication and storage systems.

### [6] [Learned Off-aperture Encoding for Wide Field-of-view RGBD Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22523)
*Haoyu Wei,Xin Liu,Yuhui Liu,Qiang Fu,Wolfgang Heidrich,Edmund Y. Lam,Yifan Peng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过将衍射光学元件（DOE）放置在非孔径位置的方法，以提升宽视场下的成像质量，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端成像系统在宽视场下难以保持高图像保真度，主要受限于计算复杂性和离轴波传播建模的困难。

Method: 通过将DOE放置在非孔径位置，实现波前的局部控制，并结合可微分的射线和波动光学模型优化深度成像质量。

Result: 实验表明，非孔径DOE在约45°视场下将成像质量提升超过5 dB PSNR，并在28°视场下成功恢复颜色和深度信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理原型验证了其有效性和多功能性，为宽视场成像系统提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs
with decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks.
However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining
high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational
complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while
accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of
placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a
global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work
explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,
enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local
control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages
hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and
wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and
demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the
off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of
approximately $45^\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming
traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and
depth information at nearly $28^\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE
configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications
validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

### [7] [trAIce3D: A Prompt-Driven Transformer Based U-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Microglial Cells from Large-Scale 3D Microscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22635)
*MohammadAmin Alamalhoda,Arsalan Firoozi,Alessandro Venturino,Sandra Siegert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: trAIce3D是一种深度学习架构，用于精确分割微胶质细胞的胞体和分支，通过两阶段方法显著提升分割精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微胶质细胞的形态对其功能至关重要，但现有分割方法在重叠结构、噪声图像和泛化性方面表现不佳，限制了临床应用。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用3D U-Net和视觉变换器检测胞体；第二阶段通过交叉注意力块细化胞体和分支。训练分为自监督胞体分割和基于提示的分支分割。

Result: 在41,230个微胶质细胞的数据集上，trAIce3D显著提高了分割精度和泛化性。

Conclusion: trAIce3D不仅适用于微胶质细胞，还可扩展到其他复杂细胞类型，如神经元和星形胶质细胞，对神经生物学研究具有广泛影响。

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within
the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D
microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for
microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with
overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter
tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We
introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia
segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage
approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects
somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the
same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,
refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a
3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:
self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch
Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and
evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly
improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis
of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its
architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and
astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

### [8] [A Dual-Feature Extractor Framework for Accurate Back Depth and Spine Morphology Estimation from Monocular RGB Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22691)
*Yuxin Wei,Yue Zhang,Moxin Zhao,Chang Shi,Jason P. Y. Cheung,Teng Zhang,Nan Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度信息的脊柱形态估计新方法，通过GAMA-Net网络精确捕捉背部深度信息，结合表面信息提升脊柱曲线生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决X射线在脊柱侧弯评估中的辐射和可及性问题，同时克服RGB图像对环境因素的敏感性。

Method: 设计GAMA-Net网络，利用双编码器提取局部和全局特征，通过PBHA模块交互，AMFF模块动态融合信息。

Result: 深度估计模型在三个评估指标上分别达到78.2%、93.6%和97.5%的准确率，脊柱形态估计准确率高达97%。

Conclusion: 结合深度和表面信息的方法显著提升了脊柱形态估计的准确性和稳定性，为脊柱侧弯评估提供了无辐射的解决方案。

Abstract: Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and
appearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common
form. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant
limitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and
remote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB
images to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible
to environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model
stability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel
pipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,
compensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine
morphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the
subtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an
adaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale
Adaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both
patch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based
Hybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)
module is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our
depth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different
evaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,
respectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we
integrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.
This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,
achieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 开发并优化了基于联邦学习的MRI前列腺分割和癌症检测框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过联邦学习在多客户端间共享数据，提升MRI前列腺分割和临床显著前列腺癌检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Flower FL和nnU-Net架构，优化本地训练轮次和联邦轮次，采用不同聚合策略（如FedMedian和FedAdagrad）。

Result: 优化后的联邦学习模型在独立测试集上显著提升了前列腺分割和癌症检测性能，尤其在病灶检测方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 联邦学习优于本地模型，优化配置可进一步提升病灶检测性能。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and optimize a federated learning (FL) framework across
multiple clients for biparametric MRI prostate segmentation and clinically
significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection. Materials and Methods: A
retrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based
architecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data
collected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training
and optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for
FL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294
patients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440
patients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice
score for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence
(PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for
performance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The
FL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved
performance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and
5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the
average performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly
improved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the
independent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection
performance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference
was observed for prostate segmentation. Conclusions: FL enhanced the
performance and generalizability of MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa
detection compared with local models, and optimizing its configuration further
improved lesion detection performance.

### [10] [Efficient handover based on Near-field and Far-field RIS for seamless connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22141)
*Atiquzzaman Mondal,Waheeb Tashan,Ayat Al-Olaimat,Hüseyin Arslan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于RIS的高效切换管理方案，通过优化信号路径减少切换频率和信令开销，提升6G网络的覆盖和连接性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络中，RIS技术能智能调控电磁波，但现有切换管理方案在高密度网络中效率不足，需优化以减少信令开销并提升移动性管理。

Method: 分析RIS辅助网络中信号强度变化，推导近场区域距离的概率密度函数，提出结合多种切换策略的新算法，以误码率为关键参数优化切换。

Result: 数值结果显示，该方法显著降低了切换率和信令负载，提升了频谱效率和能量效率，确保无缝连接和服务质量。

Conclusion: RIS辅助的切换管理方案在6G网络中具有显著优势，能有效减少不必要的切换并优化资源利用。

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is becoming a transformative
technology for the upcoming 6G communication networks, providing a way for
smartly maneuvering the electromagnetic waves to enhance coverage and
connectivity. This paper presents an efficient handover (HO) management scheme
leveraging RIS in the Fresnel region i.e., in both the near-field (NF) and
far-field (FF) regions to reduce signaling overhead and optimize mobility
management. For this, we analyzed the signal strength variations in the
considered RIS-aided networks, considering the radiative NF and FF regions, and
derive the probability density function (PDF) of the RIS-UE distance in the NF
region to quantify RIS reflection gains along the user equipment (UE)
trajectory. We propose a new HO algorithm incorporating several HO categories
like hard handover (HHO), soft handover (SHO), RIS-aided cell breathing
(RIS-CB), and RIS-aided ping-pong avoidance (RIS-PP) strategies. The proposed
algorithm uses bit error rate (BER) as a key parameter to predict the
minimization of unnecessary HOs by using RIS-aided pathways to retain
connectivity with the serving base station (BS), which minimizes the
requirement for frequent target BS searching and ultimately optimizes the HO.
By restricting measurement reports and HO requests, the suggested method
improves spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), especially in
crowded cellular networks. Numerical results highlight significant reductions
in HO rates and signaling load, ensuring seamless connectivity and improved
quality of service (QoS) in 6G systems.

### [11] [Deep Learning for Gradient and BCG Artifacts Removal in EEG During Simultaneous fMRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22263)
*K. A. Shahriar,E. H. Bhuiyan,Q. Luo,M. E. H. Chowdhury,X. J. Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的去噪自动编码器（DAR）方法，用于去除EEG-fMRI同步记录中的MR相关伪影，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-fMRI同步记录的高时空分辨率受限于MR伪影（如梯度伪影和心电伪影），影响EEG信号质量，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 使用1D卷积自动编码器（DAR）从噪声信号到清晰信号的直接映射，基于CWL EEG-fMRI数据集进行训练。

Result: DAR在RMSE、SSIM和SNR增益上显著优于传统方法（PCA、ICA等），并通过LOSO验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAR是一种高效且可解释的实时EEG伪影去除方法，适用于EEG-fMRI同步记录。

Abstract: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording combines high temporal and spatial resolution
for tracking neural activity. However, its usefulness is greatly limited by
artifacts from magnetic resonance (MR), especially gradient artifacts (GA) and
ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts, which interfere with the EEG signal. To
address this issue, we used a denoising autoencoder (DAR), a deep learning
framework designed to reduce MR-related artifacts in EEG recordings. Using
paired data that includes both artifact-contaminated and MR-corrected EEG from
the CWL EEG-fMRI dataset, DAR uses a 1D convolutional autoencoder to learn a
direct mapping from noisy to clear signal segments. Compared to traditional
artifact removal methods like principal component analysis (PCA), independent
component analysis (ICA), average artifact subtraction (AAS), and wavelet
thresholding, DAR shows better performance. It achieves a root-mean-squared
error (RMSE) of 0.0218 $\pm$ 0.0152, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of
0.8885 $\pm$ 0.0913, and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of 14.63 dB.
Statistical analysis with paired t-tests confirms that these improvements are
significant (p<0.001; Cohen's d>1.2). A leave-one-subject-out (LOSO)
cross-validation protocol shows that the model generalizes well, yielding an
average RMSE of 0.0635 $\pm$ 0.0110 and an SSIM of 0.6658 $\pm$ 0.0880 across
unseen subjects. Additionally, saliency-based visualizations demonstrate that
DAR highlights areas with dense artifacts, which makes its decisions easier to
interpret. Overall, these results position DAR as a potential and
understandable solution for real-time EEG artifact removal in simultaneous
EEG-fMRI applications.

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle
with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently
exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension
utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture
these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes
algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly
enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation
processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide
consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need
for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models
generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual
tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby
validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for
practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Method: 提出动态关闭不必要天线的量化预编码算法。

Result: 仿真显示该算法在性能和功耗上优于现有方法（如SQUID和RZF）。

Conclusion: 该算法在提升能效的同时保持了性能优势。

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one
of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless
communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user
equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of
antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains
associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To
address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to
balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this
work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free
massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates
unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby
enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm
outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford
splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior
performance while effectively reducing power consumption.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) map is a promising technique for capturing the
characteristics of multipath signal propagation, offering critical support for
channel modeling, coverage analysis, and beamforming in wireless communication
networks. This paper proposes a novel RF map construction method based on a
combination of physics-informed neural network (PINN) and graph neural network
(GNN). The PINN incorporates physical constraints derived from electromagnetic
propagation laws to guide the learning process, while the GNN models spatial
correlations among receiver locations. By parameterizing multipath signals into
received power, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA), and integrating both
physical priors and spatial dependencies, the proposed method achieves accurate
prediction of multipath parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the
method enables high-precision RF map construction under sparse sampling
conditions and delivers robust performance in both indoor and complex outdoor
environments, outperforming baseline methods in terms of generalization and
accuracy.

Abstract: This work is completed on a whim after discussions with my junior colleague.
The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus
determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information
for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map
(DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature
augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost
but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is
explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first
generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking
model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast
Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法来推导刚体定位（RBL）问题的Cramér-Rao下界（CRLB），用于评估刚体平移和旋转估计的基本精度限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅适用于点目标，无法直接用于刚体定位问题，因此需要一种通用的CRLB框架。

Method: 采用信息中心的Fisher信息矩阵（FIM）构建方法，考虑测量类型及其误差分布的影响，推导出适用于任何刚体定位场景的CRLB框架。

Result: 给出了所有CRLB的闭式表达式，包括对旋转矩阵正交约束的边界。数值结果表明，推导的表达式能正确下界化现有算法的误差。

Conclusion: 现有RBL算法仍有改进空间，新方法为评估和优化算法提供了理论工具。

Abstract: We consider a novel approach to formulate the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB)
for the rigid body localization (RBL) problem, which allows us to assess the
fundamental accuracy limits on the estimation of the translation and rotation
of a rigid body with respect to a known reference. To that end, we adopt an
information-centric construction of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which
allows to capture the contribution of each measurement towards the FIM, both in
terms of input measurement types, as well as of their error distributions.
Taking advantage of this approach, we derive a generic framework for the CRLB
formulation, which is applicable to any type of rigid body localization
scenario, extending the conventional FIM formulation suitable for point targets
to the case of a rigid body whose location include both translation vector and
the rotation matrix (or alternative the rotation angles), with respect to a
reference. Closed-form expressions for all CRLBs are given, including the bound
incorporating an orthonormality constraint onto the rotation matrix. Numerical
results illustrate that the derived expression correctly lower-bounds the
errors of estimated localization parameters obtained via various related
state-of-the-art (SotA) estimators, revealing their accuracies and suggesting
that SotA RBL algorithms can still be improved.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间注意力的深度学习方法（MsSAN），用于解决极大规模阵列（ELAA）近场信道估计问题，通过多尺度架构和创新的空间注意力机制，显著提升了信道重建性能。

Abstract: The deployment of extremely large-scale array (ELAA) brings higher spectral
efficiency and spatial degree of freedom, but triggers issues on near-field
channel estimation.
  Existing near-field channel estimation schemes primarily exploit sparsity in
the transform domain.
  However, these schemes are sensitive to the transform matrix selection and
the stopping criteria.
  Inspired by the success of deep learning (DL) in far-field channel
estimation, this paper proposes a novel spatial-attention-based method for
reconstructing extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) channel.
  Initially, the spatial antenna correlations of near-field channels are
analyzed as an expectation over the angle-distance space, which demonstrate
correlation range of an antenna element varies with its position.
  Due to the strong correlation between adjacent antenna elements, interactions
of inter-subchannel are applied to describe inherent correlation of near-field
channels instead of inter-element.
  Subsequently, a multi-scale spatial attention network (MsSAN) with the
inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities is proposed tailed to
near-field MIMO channel estimation.
  We employ the multi-scale architecture to refine the subchannel size in
MsSAN.
  Specially, we inventively introduce the sum of dot products as spatial
attention (SA) instead of cross-covariance to weight subchannel features at
different scales in the SA module.
  Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed MsSAN achieves
remarkable the inter-subchannel correlation learning capabilities and
outperforms others in terms of near-field channel reconstruction.

Abstract: We consider the channel acquisition problem for a wideband terahertz (THz)
communication system, where an extremely large-scale array is deployed to
mitigate severe path attenuation. In channel modeling, we account for both the
near-field spherical wavefront and the wideband beam-splitting phenomena,
resulting in a wideband near-field channel. We propose a frequency-independent
orthogonal dictionary that generalizes the standard discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) matrix by introducing an additional parameter to capture the near-field
property. This dictionary enables the wideband near-field channel to be
efficiently represented with a two-dimensional (2D) block-sparse structure.
Leveraging this specific sparse structure, the wideband near-field channel
estimation problem can be effectively addressed within a customized compressive
sensing framework. Numerical results demonstrate the significant advantages of
our proposed 2D block-sparsity-aware method over conventional
polar-domain-based approaches for near-field wideband channel estimation.
