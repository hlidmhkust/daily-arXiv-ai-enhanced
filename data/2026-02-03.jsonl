However, conventional methods relying on Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face two fundamental limitations: severe performance degradation in low Jamming-to-Signal Ratio (JSR) regimes due to noise obscuration, and ``feature degeneracy'' caused by the loss of phase information in magnitude-only spectrograms. Consequently, spectrally similar signals -- such as high-order Quadrature Amplitude Modulation versus Band-Limited Gaussian Noise -- become indistinguishable. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the \\textbf{JSR-Guided Fusion Network (JSR-GFNet)}. This multi-modal architecture combines phase-sensitive complex In-Phase/Quadrature (IQ) samples with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms. Central to this framework is a physics-inspired dynamic gating mechanism driven by statistical signal descriptors. Acting as a conditional controller, it autonomously estimates signal reliability to dynamically reweight the contributions of a Complex-Valued ResNet (IQ stream) and an EfficientNet backbone (STFT stream). To validate the model, we introduce the Comprehensive GNSS Interference (CGI-21) dataset, simulating 21 jamming categories including software-defined waveforms from aerial platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JSR-GFNet achieves higher accuracy across the full 10--50 dB JSR spectrum. Notably, interpretability analysis confirms that the model learns a physically intuitive strategy: prioritizing spectral energy integration in noise-limited regimes while shifting focus to phase precision in high-SNR scenarios to resolve modulation ambiguities. This framework provides a robust solution for next-generation aerospace navigation security."}

This paper presents a sub-band full-duplex (SBFD) ISAC system that assigns non-overlapping OFDM subbands to sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous operation with minimal interference. A distributed testbed with three SIMO nodes is implemented using USRP X410 devices operating at 6.8 GHz with 20 MHz bandwidth per channel. A total of 2048 OFDM subcarriers are partitioned into three subbands: two for sensing using Zadoff-Chu sequences and one for communication using QPSK. Each USRP transmits one subband while receiving signals across all three, forming a 1 x 3 SIMO node. Time synchronization is achieved through host-server coordination without external clock distribution. Indoor measurements, validated against MOCAP ground truth, confirm the feasibility of the SBFD ISAC system. The results demonstrate monostatic sensing with a velocity resolution of 0.145 m/s, and communication under NLoS conditions with a BER of 3.63e-3. Compared with a multiband benchmark requiring three times more spectrum, the SBFD configuration achieves comparable velocity estimation accuracy while conserving resources. The sensing and communication performance trade-off is determined by subcarrier allocation strategy rather than mutual interference."}

Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information.

However, forwarding raw CSI from multiple BSs to a central unit (CU) incurs prohibitive fronthaul overhead, which limits scalable cooperative positioning in practice. This paper proposes a learning-based edge-cloud cooperative positioning framework under limited-capacity fronthaul constraints. In the proposed architecture, a neural network is deployed at each BS to compress the locally estimated CSI into a quantized representation subject to a fixed fronthaul payload. The quantized CSI is transmitted to the CU, which performs cooperative 3D positioning by jointly processing the compressed CSI received from multiple BSs. The proposed framework adopts a two-stage training strategy consisting of self-supervised local training at the BSs and end-to-end joint training for positioning at the CU. Simulation results based on a 3.5~GHz 5G NR compliant urban ray-tracing scenario with six BSs and 20~MHz bandwidth show that the proposed method achieves a mean 3D positioning error of 0.48~m and a 90th-percentile error of 0.83~m, while reducing the fronthaul payload to 6.25% of lossless CSI forwarding. The achieved performance is close to that of cooperative positioning with full CSI exchange."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission."}

To address this, we present CMANet, a multi-BS cooperative positioning architecture that performs feature-level fusion of raw CSI using the proposed Channel Masked Attention (CMA) mechanism. The CMA encoder injects a physically grounded prior--per-BS channel gain--into the attention weights, thus emphasizing reliable links and suppressing spurious multipath. A lightweight LSTM decoder then treats subcarriers as a sequence to accumulate frequency-domain evidence into a final 3D position estimate. In a typical 5G NR-compliant urban simulation, CMANet achieves less than 0.5m median error and 1.0m 90th-percentile error, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Although these applications benefit from detailed visual data, the resulting data volumes impose significant challenges on satellite communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth, power, and dynamic link conditions. To address these limitations, this paper investigates Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) as an effective source-channel paradigm for the transmission of EO imagery. We focus on two complementary aspects of semantic loss in DJSCC-based systems. First, a reconstruction-centric framework is evaluated by analyzing the semantic degradation of reconstructed images under varying compression ratios and channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Second, a task-oriented framework is developed by integrating DJSCC with lightweight, application-specific models (e.g., EfficientViT), with performance measured using downstream task accuracy rather than pixel-level fidelity. Based on extensive empirical analysis, we propose a unified semantic loss framework that captures both reconstruction-centric and task-oriented performance within a single model. This framework characterizes the implicit relationship between JSCC compression, channel SNR, and semantic quality, offering actionable insights for the design of robust and efficient EO imagery transmission under resource-constrained satellite links."}

Using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to statistically model the HQN, we construct as well as visualize the corresponding pointwise entropic functions in a given 3D probabilistic landscape. When integrated over the relevant state space, these entropic surfaces yield values of the respective global entropy. Through analytical and numerical evaluation, it is demonstrated that the differential entropy approaches the quantum collision entropy under certain mixing conditions, which aligns with the Renyi entropy for order $α= 2$. Within the HQC framework, the results establish a theoretical and computational equivalence between these measures. This provides a unified perspective on quantifying uncertainty in hybrid quantum communication systems. Extending the analysis to the operational domain of finite key QKD, we demonstrated that the same $10\\%$ approximation threshold corresponds to an order-of-magnitude change in Eves success probability and a measurable reduction in the secure key rate."}

Currently, most deep learning-based LACT reconstruction methods focus on multi-domain fusion or the introduction of generic priors, failing to fully align with the core imaging characteristics of LACT-such as the directionality of artifacts and directional loss of structural information, which are caused by the absence of projection angles in certain directions. Inspired by the theory of visible and invisible singularities, taking into account the aforementioned core imaging characteristics of LACT, we propose a Visible Singularities Guided Correlation network for LACT reconstruction (VSGC). The design philosophy of VSGC consists of two core steps: First, extract VS edge features from LACT images and focus the model's attention on these VS. Second, establish correlations between the VS edge features and other regions of the image. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function with anisotropic constraint is employed to constrain the model to converge in multiple aspects. Finally, qualitative and quantitative validations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design. Particularly, in comparison with alternative methods, VSGC delivers more prominent performance in small angular ranges, with the PSNR improvement of 2.45 dB and the SSIM enhancement of 1.5\\%.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, we apply it to noisy versions of several deterministic models including Kautz, lattice, tree and bipartite networks. For contrast, we also evaluate preferential attachment networks to illustrate the behavior on stochastic graphs. We compare the performance of IterativeFT against simple real domain and frequency domain thresholding, reduced rank reconstruction and locally adaptive network sparsification. Relative to the comparison network denoising approaches, the proposed IterativeFT method provides the best overall performance for lattice and Kuatz networks with competitive performance on tree and bipartite networks.

This paper presents a data-driven IMF localization framework that directly maps induced magnetic field measurements to spatial coordinates using supervised learning, eliminating explicit environment-specific calibration. By replacing explicit field modeling with learning-based inference, the proposed approach captures nonlinear field interactions and environmental effects.

Recent works have addressed this issue using differentiable proxy models, based either on deep neural networks or hybrid coding schemes with differentiable components such as soft quantization, to approximate the codec behavior. While differentiable proxy codecs have enabled progress in compression-aware learning, they remain approximations that may not fully capture the behavior of standard, non-differentiable codecs. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence demonstrating the inefficiencies of using standard codecs during training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that enables end-to-end training with real, non-differentiable codecs by leveraging data-driven surrogate gradients derived from actual compression errors. It facilitates the alignment between training objectives and deployment performance. Experimental results show a 5.19\\% improvement in BD-BR (PSNR) compared to codec-agnostic training approaches, consistently across the entire rate-distortion convex hull spanning multiple downsampling ratios."}

Conference paper", "summary": "Precision in radiation therapy relies on immobilization systems that limit patient motion. Thermoplastic masks are commonly used for this purpose, but subtle voluntary and involuntary movements such as jaw shifts, deep breathing, or eye squinting may still compromise treatment accuracy. Existing motion tracking methods are limited: optical systems require a clear line of sight and only detect surface motion, while X-ray-based tracking introduces additional ionizing radiation. This study explores the use of low-power, non-ionizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing for through-mask motion detection. We characterize the RF properties of thermoplastic mask material in the 28-38 GHz range and perform motion detection using a 1 GHz bandwidth centered at 28 GHz. We use a frequency-domain system with horn antennas in a custom-built anechoic chamber to capture changes in the amplitude and phase of transmitted RF waves in response to subtle head and facial movements. These findings lay groundwork for future real-time through-mask motion tracking and future integration with multi-antenna systems and machine learning for error correction during radiotherapy."}

In NLOS, multipath-induced distortions typically degrade Angle-of-Arrivial (AoA) estimation accuracy. Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions. A robust preprocessing stage removes anomalous CTEs using combined univariate and multivariate criteria. Feature-wise hypothesis tests on IQ-derived power features confirm strong LOS and NLOS separability. All mean differences are statistically significant; additionally, 92 percent of feature-wise variance differences are significant. We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation. As a practice, we apply a self-supervised clustering to L-moment statistics, achieving a more separable representation, compared to product moments."}

A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios."}

The approach addresses the data-scarcity and high-distortion challenges typical of macroscopic imaging, where fully learning-based registration (e.g., VoxelMorph) often fails to generalize due to limited training diversity and large nonrigid deformations that exceed the capture range of unconstrained convolutional filters. In the proposed pipeline, the Optimal Cross-section Matching (OCM) algorithm first performs constrained global alignment: translation, rotation, and uniform scaling to establish anatomically consistent slice initialization. Next, a lightweight deep-learning refinement network, inspired by VoxelMorph, predicts residual local deformations between consecutive slices. The core novelty of this architecture lies in its hierarchical decomposition of the registration manifold. This hybrid OCM+DL design integrates explicit geometric priors with the flexible learning capacity of neural networks, ensuring stable optimization and plausible deformation fields even with few training examples. Experiments on an original dataset of 40 kidneys demonstrated better results compared to single-stage baselines. The pipeline maintains physical calibration via Hough-based grid detection and employs Bezier-based contour smoothing for robust meshing and volume estimation. Although validated on kidney data, the proposed framework generalizes to other soft-tissue organs reconstructed from optical or photographic cross-sections. By decoupling interpretable global optimization from data-efficient deep refinement, the method advances the precision, reproducibility, and anatomical realism of multimodal 3D reconstructions for surgical planning, morphological assessment, and medical education."}

They were trained and evaluated using knee, brain, and cardiac MRI datasets to assess their generalizability across body regions. While the Vanilla GAN operates on the fundamentals of the adversarial network setup, DCGAN advances image synthesis by securing the convolutional layers, giving a superior appearance to the prevalent spatial features. Training instability is resolved in WGAN through the Wasserstein distance to minimize an unstable regime, therefore, ensuring stable convergence and high-quality images.

In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains."}

This paper focuses on the angle estimation performance with antenna arrays and tackles the critical challenge of array beam pattern calibration for ISAC systems. To assess calibration quality from a sensing perspective, a novel performance metric that accounts for angle estimation error, rather than beam pattern similarity, is proposed and incorporated into a differentiable loss function.

To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters.

Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions."}

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of cine imaging on accuracy and consistency of thyroid nodule assessment, using the American College of Radiology Thyroid Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS). Methods: 50 benign and 50 malignant thyroid nodules with cytopathology results were included. A reader study with 4 specialty-trained radiologists was then conducted over 3 rounds, assessing only static images in the first two rounds and both static and cine images in the third round. TI-RADS scores and the consequent management recommendations were then evaluated by comparing them to the malignancy status of the nodules. Results: Mean sensitivity for malignancy detection was 0.65 for static images and 0.67 with both static and cine images (p>0.5). Specificity was 0.20 for static images and 0.22 with both static and cine images (p>0.5). Management recommendations were similar with and without cine images.

To reduce the number of required light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced methods commonly exploit LED shape features for positioning. Although interesting, they are typically restricted to a single LED geometry, leading to failure in heterogeneous LED-shape scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lamé curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lamé curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lamé curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-\\textit{n}-points (FreeP\\textit{n}P) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments.

Computational Miniaturized Mesoscope (CM2) alleviate the sampling limit by multiplexing multiple sub-views onto a single sensor, but introduce view crosstalk and a highly ill-conditioned inverse problem compounded by spatially variant point spread functions (PSFs). Prior learning-based spatially varying (SV) reconstruction methods typically rely on global SV operators with fixed input sizes, resulting in memory and training costs that scale poorly with image dimensions. We propose SV-CoDe (Spatially Varying Coordinate-conditioned Deconvolution), a scalable deep learning framework that achieves uniform, high-resolution reconstruction across a 6.5 mm FOV. Unlike conventional methods, SV-CoDe employs coordinate-conditioned convolutions to locally adapt reconstruction kernels; this enables patch-based training that decouples parameter count from FOV size. SV-CoDe achieves the best image quality in both simulated and experimental measurements while requiring 10x less model size and 10x less training data than prior baselines. Trained purely on physics-based simulations, the network robustly generalizes to bead phantoms, weakly scattering brain slices, and freely moving C. elegans. SV-CoDe offers a scalable, physics-aware solution for correcting SV blur in compact optical systems and is readily extendable to a broad range of biomedical imaging applications."}

This paper revisits the technical challenges of path-gain calculation from angle-resolved wideband measurements, with emphasis on angular-domain power integration where the scan beams are inherently non-orthogonal and simple power summation leads to biased omni-equivalent power estimates. We first formulate the synthesized-isotropic narrowband power in a unified matrix form and introduce a beam-accumulation correction factor, including an offset-averaged variant to mitigate scalloping due to off-grid angles.

In this work, we focus on performance guarantees for {the downlink of} cellular networks where we impose a hardcore (spatial) regulation on base station (BS) locations and evaluate {how BS scheduling (which controls which BSs can transmit at a given time) impacts performance}. Hardcore regulation is the simplest form of spatial regulation that enforces a minimal distance between any pair of transmitters in the network.

Such differentiated coding typically induces a sharp-peaked and heavy-tailed distribution. This distribution characteristic mathematically necessitates a probability model with adaptable shape parameters for accurate description. However, existing methods commonly use a Gaussian model to fit this distribution, resulting in a loss of coding performance. To systematically analyze the impact of this distribution on ROI coding, we develop a unified rate-distortion optimization theoretical paradigm. Building on this paradigm, we propose a novel Generalized Gaussian Model (GGM) to achieve flexible modeling of the latent variables distribution. To support stable optimization of GGM, we introduce effective differentiable functions and further propose a dynamic lower bound to alleviate train-test mismatch. Moreover, finite differences are introduced to solve the gradient computation after GGM fits the distribution. Experiments on COCO2017 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art in both ROI reconstruction and downstream tasks (e.g., Segmentation, Object Detection). Furthermore, compared to classical probability models, our GGM provides a more precise fit to feature distributions and achieves superior coding performance.

This paper presents a unified framework to jointly characterise resolution and aliasing in NF localisation and study the trade-off between the two. Leveraging the concept of local chirp spatial frequency, we derive analytical expressions linking array geometry and sampling density to the spatial bandwidth of the received field. We introduce two geometric tools--Critical Antenna Elements (CAEs) and the Non-Contributive Zone (NCZ)--to intuitively identify how individual antennas contribute to resolution and/or aliasing. Our analysis reveals that resolution and aliasing are not always strictly coupled, e.g., increasing the array aperture can improve resolution without necessarily aggravating aliasing.

In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication."}

These acoustically driven patterns make ultrasound challenging for algorithms originally designed for natural images. To bridge this gap, the field has increasingly turned to foundation models, hoping to leverage their generalization capabilities. However, these models often falter in ultrasound applications because they are not designed for ultrasound physics, they are merely trained on ultrasound data. Therefore, it is essential to integrate ultrasound-specific domain knowledge into established learning frameworks. We achieve this by reformulating self-supervised learning as a texture-analysis problem, introducing texture ultrasound semantic analysis (TUSA). Using TUSA, models learn to leverage highly scalable contrastive methods to extract true domain-specific representations directly from simple B-mode images. We train a TUSA model on a combination of open-source, simulated, and in vivo data. The latent space is compared to several larger foundation models, demonstrating that our approach gives TUSA models better generalizability for difficult downstream tasks on unique online datasets as well as a clinical eye dataset collected for this study. Our model achieves higher accuracy in detecting COVID (70%), spinal hematoma (100%) and vitreous hemorrhage (97%) and correlates more closely with quantitative parameters like liver steatosis (r = 0.83), ejection fraction (r = 0.63), and oxygen saturation (r = 0.38).

DoA estimation is cast as a multi-label classification problem on a discretized angular grid, while rain-rate estimation is formulated as a multi-class classification task. We then propose a multi-task deep CNN with a shared feature extractor and two task-specific heads, trained using an uncertainty-weighted objective to automatically balance the two losses. Numerical results in a two-source scenario show that the proposed network achieves lower DoA RMSE than classical baselines and provides accurate rain-rate classification at moderate-to-high SNRs."}

We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels.

Specifically, MarkCleaner is trained with micro-geometry-perturbed supervision, which encourages the model to separate semantic content from strict spatial alignment and enables robust reconstruction under subtle geometric displacements. The framework adopts a mask-guided encoder that learns explicit spatial representations and a 2D Gaussian Splatting-based decoder that explicitly parameterizes geometric perturbations while preserving semantic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MarkCleaner achieves superior performance in both watermark removal effectiveness and visual fidelity, while enabling efficient real-time inference.

Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes."}

In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical performance analysis framework for different RFF feature extraction methods using the silhouette score as an evaluation metric, and propose a precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method that enhances the silhouette score without requiring channel estimation. First, we employ the silhouette score as an evaluation metric and obtain the theoretical performance of various RFF feature extraction methods using the Taylor series expansion. Next, we mitigate channel effects by computing the reciprocal of the received signal in the frequency domain at the device under authentication. We then compare these methods across three different scenarios: the deterministic channel scenario, the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic channel scenario, and the non-i.i.d. stochastic channel scenario. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the silhouette score is an efficient metric to evaluate classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method achieves the highest silhouette score and classification accuracy under channel variations."}

A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency.

However, practical adoption is hindered by the reliance on gradient-based optimization to estimate model parameters on a per-image basis - a process that is computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Initialization strategies for SMoE are an essential component that directly affects convergence and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel, edge-based initialization scheme that achieves good reconstruction qualities while reducing the need for stochastic optimization significantly. Through a method that leverages Canny edge detection to extract a sparse set of image contours, kernel positions and orientations are deterministically inferred.

Among various amodal sensing paradigms, wireless amodal sensing is a potential solution due to its advantages of environmental robustness, privacy preservation, and low cost. However, the sensing data obtained by wireless system is sparse for shape reconstruction because of the low spatial resolution, and this issue is further intensified in complex environments with occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless amodal sensing scheme that leverages a large-scale RIS to enhance the spatial resolution and create reflection paths that can bypass the obstacles. A generative learning model is also employed to reconstruct the complete shape based on the sensing data captured from the viewpoint of the RIS. In such a system, it is challenging to optimize the RIS phase shifts because the relationship between RIS phase shifts and amodal sensing accuracy is complex and the closed-form expression is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we develop an error prediction model that learns the mapping from RIS phase shifts to amodal sensing accuracy, and optimizes RIS phase shifts based on this mapping. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves at least a 56.73% reduction in reconstruction error compared to conventional schemes under the same number of RIS configurations."}

Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions."}

We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance."}

However, with the increasing number of UAVs and explosive wireless data, the existing bit-oriented communication network has approached the Shannon capacity, which cannot satisfy the quality of service (QoS) with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for command and control (C\\&C) transmission in bit-oriented UAV communication networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission."}

A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios."}

This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\\%."}

We propose an efficient \\emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings."}
