### [1] [Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593)
*Sandesh Rao Mattu,Nishant Mehrotra,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Zak-OTFS的差分通信方案，无需周期性发送导频信号，提高了频谱效率和能量利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zak-OTFS在延迟-多普勒（DD）域中信号处理具有可预测性，但仍需周期性导频传输。本文旨在消除这一需求。

Method: 利用DD域信道的预测能力，将检测到的数据符号作为导频，通过前一时刻的信道估计检测下一时刻的数据。

Result: 方案实现了更高的频谱效率和能量利用率，且在较低复杂度下比现有方案具有更好的误码率性能。

Conclusion: 提出的差分通信方案有效减少了导频需求，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a
delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is
carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is
predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically,
albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication
scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot
transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be
used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data
can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the
communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD
channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data
symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next
instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it
allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would
otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols.
Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded
pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot
scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower
complexity.

### [2] [Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12630)
*Dianxin Luan,John Thompson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种离线训练的神经网络设计标准，通过生成合成训练数据集，确保网络在新信道上达到特定MSE，无需实时调整参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在新数据上性能下降的问题，适应无线信道的时变特性，同时满足低延迟和有限计算资源的需求。

Method: 设计合成训练数据集的标准，提出基准设计，验证不同复杂度神经网络的泛化能力。

Result: 神经网络在固定和可变延迟扩展的信道上均表现出稳健的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了无需实时调整的神经网络设计，适用于多种信道场景。

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables
intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate
information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural
networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel
or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new
data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training
knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be
time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited
computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing
resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This
motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform
robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information
being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to
generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that
after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error
(MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network
solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for
real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further
propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different
channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks
with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved
appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations,
neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both
fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

### [3] [A Novel Data Augmentation Strategy for Robust Deep Learning Classification of Biomedical Time-Series Data: Application to ECG and EEG Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12645)
*Mohammed Guhdar,Ramadhan J. Mstafa,Abdulhakeem O. Mohammed*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的深度学习框架，用于处理多种生物信号（如ECG和EEG），通过结合ResNet CNN和注意力机制，并采用新颖的数据增强策略，解决了信号多样性和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多传感器融合技术在处理不同生理信号时缺乏统一架构，且生物医学数据集存在类别不平衡问题，导致传统方法性能偏差。

Method: 结合ResNet CNN和注意力机制，采用时间域信号拼接的数据增强策略，并使用Focal Loss函数处理类别不平衡。预处理包括小波去噪、基线去除和标准化。

Result: 在UCI Seizure EEG、MIT-BIH Arrhythmia和PTB Diagnostic ECG数据集上分别达到99.96%、99.78%和100%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种信号类型和临床场景中表现出鲁棒性，且适用于低端或可穿戴设备部署。

Abstract: The increasing need for accurate and unified analysis of diverse biological
signals, such as ECG and EEG, is paramount for comprehensive patient
assessment, especially in synchronous monitoring. Despite advances in
multi-sensor fusion, a critical gap remains in developing unified architectures
that effectively process and extract features from fundamentally different
physiological signals. Another challenge is the inherent class imbalance in
many biomedical datasets, often causing biased performance in traditional
methods. This study addresses these issues by proposing a novel and unified
deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance across
different signal types. Our method integrates a ResNet-based CNN with an
attention mechanism, enhanced by a novel data augmentation strategy:
time-domain concatenation of multiple augmented variants of each signal to
generate richer representations. Unlike prior work, we scientifically increase
signal complexity to achieve future-reaching capabilities, which resulted in
the best predictions compared to the state of the art. Preprocessing steps
included wavelet denoising, baseline removal, and standardization. Class
imbalance was effectively managed through the combined use of this advanced
data augmentation and the Focal Loss function. Regularization techniques were
applied during training to ensure generalization. We rigorously evaluated the
proposed architecture on three benchmark datasets: UCI Seizure EEG, MIT-BIH
Arrhythmia, and PTB Diagnostic ECG. It achieved accuracies of 99.96%, 99.78%,
and 100%, respectively, demonstrating robustness across diverse signal types
and clinical contexts. Finally, the architecture requires ~130 MB of memory and
processes each sample in ~10 ms, suggesting suitability for deployment on
low-end or wearable devices.

### [4] [Enhancing Urban GNSS Positioning Reliability via Conservative Satellite Selection Using Unanimous Voting Across Multiple Machine Learning Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12706)
*Sanghyun Kim,Jiwon Seo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于多机器学习分类器一致投票的保守卫星选择策略，以增强城市环境中GNSS定位的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中建筑物导致的信号遮挡和多径效应会显著增加GNSS定位误差，需要一种更可靠的方法来改善定位性能。

Method: 使用随机森林（RF）、梯度提升决策树（GBDT）和支持向量机（SVM）三种模型进行LOS/NLOS分类，并通过一致投票和置信度阈值选择卫星。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了定位成功率和接收器包含率，尽管卫星数量减少导致定位范围略有增加。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了城市GNSS环境的定位可靠性。

Abstract: In urban environments, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning
is often compromised by signal blockages and multipath effects caused by
buildings, leading to significant positioning errors. To address this issue,
this study proposes a robust enhancement of zonotope shadow matching
(ZSM)-based positioning by employing a conservative satellite selection
strategy using unanimous voting across multiple machine learning classifiers.
Three distinct models - random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision tree
(GBDT), and support vector machine (SVM) - were trained to perform
line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification based on global
positioning system (GPS) signal features. A satellite is selected for
positioning only when all classifiers unanimously agree on its classification
and their associated confidence scores exceed a threshold. Experiments with
real-world GPS data collected in dense urban areas demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly improves the positioning success rate and the
receiver containment rate, even with imperfect LOS/NLOS classification.
Although a slight increase in the position bound was observed due to the
reduced number of satellites used, overall positioning reliability was
substantially enhanced, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach
in urban GNSS environments.

### [5] [Beamforming Tradeoff for Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12917)
*Xi Ding,Luca Kunz,E. Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SDR的联合波束成形优化框架，用于小规模无小区MIMO系统中的联合感知与通信，确保全局最优解且无需后处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联合感知与通信优化中缺乏全局最优性或需要额外降秩步骤，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用SDR优化框架，并提出一种基准策略，将每个接入点专用于通信或感知。

Result: 提出的框架提供了全局最优且计算高效的波束成形设计。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代无线网络的发展提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: This paper studies optimal joint beamforming (BF) for joint sensing and
communication (JSAC) in small-scale cell-free MIMO (CF-MIMO) systems. While
prior works have explored JSAC optimization using methods such as successive
convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR), many of these
approaches either lack global optimality or require additional rank-reduction
steps. In contrast, we propose an SDR-based optimization framework that
guarantees globally optimal solutions without post-processing. To benchmark its
performance, we introduce a standalone BF strategy that dedicates each access
point (AP) exclusively to either communication or sensing. The proposed
formulation builds upon a general multi-user system model, enabling future
extensions beyond the single-user setting. Overall, our framework offers a
globally optimal and computationally efficient BF design, providing valuable
insights for the development of next-generation wireless networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对高移动性通信场景，AFDM是一种有前景的多载波技术，但需要进一步提升其频谱和能量效率。

Method: 设计了MM-AFDM-IM方案，通过为不同子载波选择多种星座模式，并结合动态模式选择和子载波激活传递额外信息。

Result: 仿真结果表明，MM-AFDM-IM在性能上优于传统方案，并推导了其误码率上限。

Conclusion: MM-AFDM-IM是一种高效且性能优越的调制方案，适用于高移动性通信场景。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), a promising multicarrier
technique utilizing chirp signals, has been envisioned as an effective solution
for high-mobility communication scenarios. In this paper, we develop a
multiple-mode index modulation scheme tailored for AFDM, termed as MM-AFDM-IM,
which aims to further improve the spectral and energy efficiencies of AFDM.
Specifically, multiple constellation alphabets are selected for different
chirp-based subcarriers (chirps). Aside from classical amplitude/phase
modulation, additional information bits can be conveyed by the dynamic patterns
of both constellation mode selection and chirp activation, without extra energy
consumption. Furthermore, we discuss the mode selection strategy and derive an
asymptotically tight upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed
scheme under maximum-likelihood detection. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the superior performance of MM-AFDM-IM compared to conventional
benchmark schemes.

### [7] [Unmodulated Visible Light Positioning: A Deep Dive into Techniques, Studies, and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13080)
*Morteza Alijani,Wout Joseph,David Plets*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文介绍了未调制可见光定位（uVLP）技术，分析了其与传统VLP的差异，并分类了现有uVLP技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLP技术因调制LED导致成本高和照明效率低，uVLP利用未调制光源提供低成本、高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过比较uVLP与传统VLP，分类uVLP技术为基于强度和基于成像的方法，并提出分类框架。

Result: uVLP提供了一种低成本、高效的室内定位解决方案，但仍需解决技术挑战。

Conclusion: uVLP是未来室内定位的有前景方向，需进一步研究以实现其广泛应用。

Abstract: Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology for
next-generation indoor positioning systems (IPS), particularly within the scope
of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Its attractiveness stems from
leveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision
positioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread
adoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the
increased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,
which consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant
flux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept
of unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals
of Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as
conventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure
alternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation
hardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the
fundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus
conventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to
receiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar
cells, etc.) and imaging-based methods. Additionally, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy categorizing techniques into demultiplexed and
undemultiplexed approaches. Within this structured framework, we critically
review current advancements in uVLP, discuss prevailing challenges, and outline
promising research directions essential for developing robust, scalable, and
widely deployable uVLP solutions.

### [8] [Angle Estimation of a Single Source with Massive Uniform Circular Arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13086)
*Mingyan Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于均匀圆形阵列（UCA）的简单二维DOA估计方法，适用于实时信号处理，并能处理非均匀噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 均匀线性阵列只能估计方位角，而UCA能提供360度方位角和仰角信息，因此需要一种简单高效的DOA估计方法。

Method: 通过量化方位角并计算协方差来估计方位角，再通过显式公式估计仰角，计算简单。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法能有效估计方位角和仰角，并可作为高精度多维搜索的初始点。

Conclusion: 该方法计算简单，适用于实时处理，且在非均匀噪声下仍有效。

Abstract: Estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of incoming plane waves is an
essential topic in array signal processing. Widely adopted uniform linear
arrays can only provide estimates of source azimuth. Thus, uniform circular
arrays (UCAs) are attractive in that they can provide $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal
coverage and additional elevation angle information. Considering that with a
massive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent
azimuth angles over $360^{\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple
two-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this
method, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating
and comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle
estimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is
computationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing. Numerical
results verify that the proposed method can obtain azimuth as well as elevation
angle estimates and the estimates can be used as starting points of
multidimensional searches for methods with higher accuracy. Additionally, the
proposed method can still work in the presence of nonuniform noise.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多端口S参数的模型，用于预测多频操作结构的散射特性，适用于非周期配置和时变调制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型难以准确预测多频操作和时变调制结构的散射行为，需要更先进的建模方法。

Result: 模型验证表明其准确性和实用性，适用于广泛的通信和传感系统。

Conclusion: 该模型为多频和时变调制结构的精确分析和优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Utilizing scatterers in communication engineering, such as reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) and backscatter systems, requires physically
consistent models for accurate performance prediction. A multiport model, which
also accounts for structural scattering, has been developed for non-periodic
scatterers. However, many emerging systems operate at multiple frequencies or
generate intermodulation harmonics, particularly when incorporating space-time
modulation (STM) or dynamic load control. These functionalities demand advanced
modeling approaches capable of capturing scattering behavior across several
frequencies and directions simultaneously. This article extends a multiport
S-parameters-based model for predicting the scattering properties of
multifrequency operating structures. The model extends the applicability of
convenient S-matrix models to time-modulated multiport structures. Unlike known
approaches, this model incorporates structural scattering, mutual coupling, the
possibility of non-digital modulation, and non-periodic configurations,
enabling precise analysis and optimization for a broad range of communication
and sensing systems. Validation against experimental results for a space-time
modulated scattering structure demonstrates the accuracy and practical
applicability of the proposed model.

### [10] [Disentangling coincident cell events using deep transfer learning and compressive sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13176)
*Moritz Leuthner,Rafael Vorländer,Oliver Hayden*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合全卷积神经网络（FCN）和压缩感知（CS）的混合框架，用于解决单细胞分析中的信号重叠问题，显著提高了事件恢复率和分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞分析在诊断和细胞治疗中至关重要，但信号重叠会严重影响数据准确性。

Method: 使用FCN估计重叠事件数量，结合CS重构信号，无需重新训练即可泛化到不同细胞类型。

Result: 相比传统算法，恢复率提高21%，分类准确率超过97%。

Conclusion: 该框架为非光学单细胞传感平台奠定了基础，扩展了细胞计数在精准医学中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate single-cell analysis is critical for diagnostics, immunomonitoring,
and cell therapy, but coincident events - where multiple cells overlap in a
sensing zone - can severely compromise signal fidelity. We present a hybrid
framework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive
sensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor
data. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates
coincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and
CD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module
reconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise
recovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and
hydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine
algorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and
improving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class
activation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures
transparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow
cytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating
modalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse
sensing. This work lays the foundation for next-generation non-optical
single-cell sensing platforms that are automated, generalizable, and capable of
resolving overlapping events, broadening the utility of cytometry in
translational medicine and precision diagnostics, e.g. cell-interaction
studies.

### [11] [Pathology-Guided Virtual Staining Metric for Evaluation and Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12624)
*Qiankai Wang,James E. D. Tweel,Parsin Haji Reza,Anita Layton*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了PaPIS（病理感知感知图像相似性），一种专门针对虚拟染色评估的新型图像质量评估指标，通过深度学习和细胞形态学分割特征更好地反映组织学感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的虚拟染色评估方法主要依赖为自然图像设计的传统图像质量评估指标（如结构相似性），这些指标往往无法捕捉病理相关特征。专家病理学评审虽然可用，但具有主观性强、耗时长的缺点。因此需要开发专门针对病理学的评估框架。

Method: 提出PaPIS（病理感知感知图像相似性）指标，利用在细胞形态学分割上训练的深度学习特征，并结合Retinex启发的特征分解技术，专门为虚拟染色评估量身定制，以更好地反映组织学感知质量。

Result: 对比实验表明，PaPIS能够更准确地与病理相关的视觉线索对齐，并能识别传统和现有感知指标往往忽略的细微细胞结构。将PaPIS作为虚拟染色模型的引导损失函数，可以提高组织学保真度。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了病理感知评估框架对于推进虚拟染色技术发展和临床应用准备的重要性，为虚拟染色领域提供了更适合的评估工具。

Abstract: Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image
transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on
full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural
similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to
capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been
used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming.
  In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image
Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining
evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell
morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition
to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments
demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual
cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing
perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a
guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved
histological fidelity.
  This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation
frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual
staining technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低收入和中等收入国家及资源有限地区眼病早期筛查的医疗资源不足问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：实时图像质量评估、疾病诊断模型和DR分级模型。创新包括多模态融合技术、预训练方法和多任务模型。

Result: 图像质量检查器准确率接近100%，多模态预训练疾病诊断模型性能优于仅使用图像的模型。

Conclusion: InSight流程在多种图像条件下表现稳健，诊断准确率高，计算效率高。

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect
hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is
essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income
countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an
AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate
diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality
assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity.
Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal
fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b)
Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions;
and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of
BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets,
both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality
checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images.
The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only
images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image
conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases,
generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model
contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times
computationally efficient compared to having five individual models
corresponding to each disease.

*Rajesh Sureddi,Saman Zadtootaghaj,Nabajeet Barman,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比三元组学习的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过构建自定义数据集和结合内容与质量特征，解决了数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）因缺乏参考图像和主观标注数据有限而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖大规模预训练数据。

Method: 构建自定义数据集，结合内容与质量特征，使用对比三元组学习方法训练质量感知模型。

Result: 模型在少量样本下表现出色，并在公开数据集上具有强泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为NR-IQA提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models aim to predict perceptual image quality
in alignment with human judgments. No-Reference (NR) IQA remains particularly
challenging due to the absence of a reference image. While deep learning has
significantly advanced this field, a major hurdle in developing NR-IQA models
is the limited availability of subjectively labeled data. Most existing deep
learning-based NR-IQA approaches rely on pre-training on large-scale datasets
before fine-tuning for IQA tasks. To further advance progress in this area, we
propose a novel approach that constructs a custom dataset using a limited
number of reference content images and introduces a no-reference IQA model that
incorporates both content and quality features for perceptual quality
prediction. Specifically, we train a quality-aware model using contrastive
triplet-based learning, enabling efficient training with fewer samples while
achieving strong generalization performance across publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: Pixel Perfect MegaMed在医学图像合成中表现出色，为临床诊断和下游任务提供了新工具。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis presents unique challenges due to the inherent
complexity and high-resolution details required in clinical contexts.
Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for
high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained
details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we
introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to
synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale
transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution
medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical
context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment
techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel
Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual
representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the
CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful
chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution
synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification,
showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation,
particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is critical for computeraided diagnosis
of coronary artery disease (CAD), yet it remains challenging due to the small
size, complex morphology, and low contrast with surrounding tissues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation framework that leverages the
power of vision foundation models (VFMs) through a parallel encoding
architecture. Specifically, a vision transformer (ViT) encoder within the VFM
captures global structural features, enhanced by the activation of the final
two ViT blocks and the integration of an attention-guided enhancement (AGE)
module, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder extracts local
details. These complementary features are adaptively fused using a cross-branch
variational fusion (CVF) module, which models latent distributions and applies
variational attention to assign modality-specific weights. Additionally, we
introduce an evidential-learning uncertainty refinement (EUR) module, which
quantifies uncertainty using evidence theory and refines uncertain regions by
incorporating multi-scale feature aggregation and attention mechanisms, further
enhancing segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on one in-house and two
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
accurate coronary artery segmentation and showcasing strong generalization
across multiple datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of orbital bones in facial computed tomography (CT)
images is essential for the creation of customized implants for reconstruction
of defected orbital bones, particularly challenging due to the ambiguous
boundaries and thin structures such as the orbital medial wall and orbital
floor. In these ambiguous regions, existing segmentation approaches often
output disconnected or under-segmented results. We propose a novel framework
that corrects segmentation results by leveraging consensus from multiple
diffusion model outputs. Our approach employs a conditional Bernoulli diffusion
model trained on diverse annotation patterns per image to generate multiple
plausible segmentations, followed by a consensus-driven correction that
incorporates position proximity, consensus level, and gradient direction
similarity to correct challenging regions. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing methods, significantly improving recall in
ambiguous regions while preserving the continuity of thin structures.
Furthermore, our method automates the manual process of segmentation result
correction and can be applied to image-guided surgical planning and surgery.

Motivation: 解决DDPMs在健康组织修复中采样速度慢的问题，同时保持高质量修复效果。

Method: 结合DDPMs与GANs，采用方差保持噪声调度和特定重建损失，开发了3D小波扩散模型fastWDM3D。

Result: fastWDM3D在BraTS测试集上SSIM为0.8571，MSE为0.0079，PSNR为22.26，仅需2个时间步，速度提升800倍。

Conclusion: fastWDM3D是一种快速且准确的健康组织修复方法，具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: Healthy tissue inpainting has significant applications, including the
generation of pseudo-healthy baselines for tumor growth models and the
facilitation of image registration. In previous editions of the BraTS Local
Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but
suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D
image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks
(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D
inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule
and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for
high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial
training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet
diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting
model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a
PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these
scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81
s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue
inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior
performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising
approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting. Our code is available

### [19] [SpectraLift: Physics-Guided Spectral-Inversion Network for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13339)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F. Duarte*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SpectraLift是一种自监督框架，通过融合低分辨率高光谱图像（LR-HSI）和高分辨率多光谱图像（HR-MSI），无需点扩散函数（PSF）校准或真实高分辨率高光谱图像（HR-HSI），即可恢复高空间分辨率的高光谱图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高空间分辨率的高光谱图像（HSI）在遥感和医学成像中至关重要，但现有传感器难以同时实现高空间分辨率和高光谱分辨率。现有融合方法需要PSF校准或真实HR-HSI，实际应用中难以获取。

Method: SpectraLift利用多光谱图像的谱响应函数（SRF），训练一个轻量级多层感知机（MLP），通过合成低分辨率多光谱图像（LR-MSI）和LR-HSI作为输入输出，以L1谱重建损失优化。推理时，将HR-MSI映射为HR-HSI估计。

Result: SpectraLift在PSNR、SAM、SSIM和RMSE指标上优于现有方法，且无需PSF校准或真实HR-HSI，收敛速度快。

Conclusion: SpectraLift是一种高效、自监督的HSI-MSI融合方法，适用于实际场景，显著提升了高光谱图像的空间分辨率。

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for
applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors
inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing
high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with
low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to
recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most
state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF)
calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are
impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully
self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the
MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight
per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic
low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the
SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an
$\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as
the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network
to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in
minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

Conclusion: 夹持天线技术在高频通信系统中具有潜力，尤其在用户位置不确定时，通过优化天线位置和资源分配可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Pinching-antenna technology has lately showcased its promising capability for
reconfiguring wireless propagation environments, especially in high-frequency
communication systems like millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. By dynamically
placing the antenna over a dielectric waveguide, line-of-sight (LoS)
connections can be made to significantly improve system performance. Although
recent research have illustrated the advantages of pinching-antenna-assisted
designs, they mainly presuppose complete knowledge of user locations -- an
impractical assumption in real-world systems. To address this issue, the robust
resource allocation in a multi-user pinching antenna downlink system with
uncertain user positions is investigated, aiming to minimize total transmit
power while satisfying individual outage probability constraints. First, we
address the single-user case, deriving the optimal pinching antenna position
and obtaining the corresponding power allocation using a bisection method
combined with geometric analysis. We then extend this solution to the
multi-user case. In this case, we optimize the pinching antenna position using
a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to handle the resulting
non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fixed-antenna
systems and validate the effectiveness of the PSO-based antenna placement
strategy under location uncertainty.

Conclusion: 为现有无线网络中实现语义通信提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective approach for semantic
communication. However, current JSCC methods are difficult to integrate with
existing communication network architectures, where application and network
providers are typically different entities. Recently, a novel paradigm termed
Split DeepJSCC has been under consideration to address this challenge. Split
DeepJSCC employs a bit-level interface that enables separate design of source
and channel codes, ensuring compatibility with existing communication networks
while preserving the advantages of JSCC in terms of semantic fidelity and
channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a learning-based interface
design by treating its parameters as trainable, achieving improved end-to-end
performance compared to Split DeepJSCC. In particular, the interface enables
specification of bit-level importance at the output of the source code.
Furthermore, we propose an Importance-Aware Net that utilizes the
interface-derived bit importance information, enabling dynamical adaptation to
diverse channel bandwidth ratios and time-varying channel conditions.
Experimental results show that our method improves performance in wireless
image transmission tasks. This work provides a potential solution for realizing
semantic communications in existing wireless networks.

Conclusion: 提出的ISAC波束成形设计显著提升了近场ISAC系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This letter investigates the robust beamforming design for a near-field
secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with multiple
communication users (CUs) and targets, as well as multiple eavesdroppers.
Taking into account the channel uncertainty constraints, we maximize the
minimum sensing beampattern gain for targets, subject to the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each CU and the
maximum SINR constraint for each eavesdropper, as well as the ISAC transmit
power constraint. The formulated design problem is non-convex. As a
low-complexity suboptimal solution, we first apply the S-Procedure to convert
semi-infinite channel uncertainty constraints into linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs) and then use the state-of-the-art sequential rank-one constraint
relaxation (SROCR) method to address the rank-one constraints. The numerical
results show that the proposed ISAC beamforming design scheme outperforms the
existing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and other baseline schemes, and it
significantly enhances security and robustness for near-field ISAC systems.

Conclusion: PA辅助方案显著提升了ISAC系统的感知性能和通信安全性。

Abstract: In this letter, a pinching antenna (PA)-aided scheme for establishing a
secure integrated sensing and communication system (ISAC) is investigated. The
underlying system comprises a dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) base
station (BS) linked to multiple waveguides to serve several downlink users
while sensing a set of malicious targets in a given area. The PA-aided BS aims
at preserving communication confidentiality with the legitimate users while
being able to detect malicious targets. One objective of the proposed scheme is
to optimize the PA locations, based on which an optimal design of the
legitimate signal beamforming and artificial noise covariance matrices is
provided to maximize the network's sensing performance, subject to secrecy and
total power constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme
through numerical examples and compare that against a traditional DFRC ISAC
system with a uniform linear array of half-wavelength-spaced antennas. We show
that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline PA-aided scheme with
equidistant PAs by $3$ dB in terms of illumination power, while it can provide
gains of up to $30$ dB of the same metric against a traditional ISAC system
with half-wavelength-space uniform linear arrays.

Abstract: We reinvestigate the general distributed secure source coding based on the
common key cryptosystem proposed by Oohama and Santoso (ITW 2021). They
proposed a framework of distributed source encryption and derived the necessary
and sufficient conditions to have reliable and secure transmission. However,
the bounds of the rate region, which specifies both necessary and sufficient
conditions to have reliable and secure transmission under the proposed
cryptosystem, were derived based on a self-tailored non-standard} security
criterion. In this paper we adopt the standard security criterion, i.e.,
standard mutual information. We successfully establish the bounds of the rate
region based on this security criterion. Information spectrum method and a
variant of Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem play an important role in deriving the
result.

Abstract: As the main issue in pinching-antenna system design, antenna location
optimization is key to realizing channel reconfigurability and system
flexibility. Most existing works in this area adopt sophisticated optimization
and learning tools to identify the optimal antenna locations in a numerical
manner, where insightful understandings of the pinching antenna placement are
still missing. Motivated by this research gap, this paper aims to carry out
analytical optimization for pinching antenna placement, where closed-form
solutions for the optimal antenna locations are obtained to reveal the impact
of antenna placement on the system performance. In particular, for the
user-fairness-oriented orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based transmission,
analytical results are obtained to reveal that the pinching antenna needs to be
activated at the place that would be beneficial to all served users; however,
the users' distances to the waveguide have no impact on the location selection.
For the greedy-allocation-based OMA transmission, an asymptotic study based on
a high signal-to-noise ratio approximation is carried out to show that the
optimal antenna location is in close proximity to the user who is nearest to
the waveguide. For non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission,
even with a user-fairness-oriented objective, the obtained analytical results
show that the optimal antenna location is not the position that can benefit all
users, but rather is near the user positioned closest to the waveguide.
