### [1] [Rate-Adaptive Semantic Communication via Multi-Stage Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02646)
*Jinsung Park,Junyong Shin,Yongjeong Oh,Jihun Park,Yo-Seb Jeon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于多阶段向量量化的速率自适应语义通信框架MSVQ-SC，通过动态激活阶段和模块实现细粒度速率控制，降低复杂度和码本崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单阶段VQ方法需要指数级增大码本才能提高保真度，计算复杂且存在码本崩溃问题。需要一种能灵活适应不同比特约束的语义通信方案。

Method: 将量化过程分解为多个阶段，动态激活阶段和VQ模块；提出模块选择问题，使用增量分配算法优化；结合熵编码利用非均匀码字分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上的仿真表明，该方法优于现有数字语义通信方法，在更低复杂度下获得更好的语义保真度，并提供灵活的速率控制。

Conclusion: MSVQ-SC框架通过多阶段VQ和动态模块激活，有效解决了语义通信中的速率自适应问题，在性能和复杂度间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for rate-adaptive semantic
communication based on multi-stage vector quantization (VQ), termed
\textit{MSVQ-SC}. Unlike conventional single-stage VQ approaches, which require
exponentially larger codebooks to achieve higher fidelity, the proposed
framework decomposes the quantization process into multiple stages and
dynamically activates both stages and individual VQ modules. This design
enables fine-grained rate adaptation under varying bit constraints while
mitigating computational complexity and the codebook collapse problem. To
optimize performance, we formulate a module selection problem that minimizes
task loss subject to a rate constraint and solve it using an incremental
allocation algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the framework by incorporating
entropy coding to exploit non-uniform codeword distributions, further reducing
communication overhead. Simulation results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate
that the proposed framework outperforms existing digital semantic communication
methods, achieving superior semantic fidelity with lower complexity while
providing flexible and fine-grained rate control.

### [2] [Mutual Information-Driven Visualization and Clustering for Core KPI Selection in O-RAN Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02696)
*Anish Pradhan,Lingjia Liu,Harpreet S. Dhillon*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AMIF-MDS方法使用聚合互信息(AMIF)作为定向信息的实用代理，结合多维缩放(MDS)来量化和可视化O-RAN时间序列测试数据中的依赖关系，识别核心性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着O-RAN系统复杂度增加，性能测量数量呈指数增长，测试变得困难。需要识别各种性能测量之间的依赖关系以简化测试流程和改进系统设计。

Method: 提出AMIF-MDS方法：使用基于分位数的AMIF估计器量化时间序列相似性，通过MDS可视化序列间依赖关系，并应用DBSCAN聚类识别相互信息化的指标组。

Result: 该方法能够有机地揭示链路自适应指标等集群，并为未来学习驱动的O-RAN测试产生一组核心性能测量集。

Conclusion: AMIF-MDS为O-RAN系统提供了一种有效的性能测量依赖关系分析方法，有助于简化测试流程和聚焦核心性能指标。

Abstract: O-RAN testing is becoming increasingly difficult with the exponentially
growing number of performance measurements as the system grows more complex,
with additional units, interfaces, applications, and possible implementations
and configurations. To simplify the testing procedure and improve system design
for O-RAN systems, it is important to identify the dependencies among various
performance measurements, which are inherently time-series and can be modeled
as realizations of random processes. While information theory can be utilized
as a principled foundation for mapping these dependencies, the robust
estimation of such measures for random processes from real-world data remains
challenging. This paper introduces AMIF-MDS, which employs aggregate mutual
Information in frequency (AMIF), a practical proxy for directed information
(DI), to quantify similarity and visualize inter-series dependencies with
multidimensional scaling (MDS). The proposed quantile-based AMIF estimator is
applied to O-RAN time-series testing data to identify dependencies among
various performance measures so that we can focus on a set of ``core''
performance measures. Applying density-based spatial clustering of applications
with noise (DBSCAN) to the MDS embedding groups mutually informative metrics,
organically reveals the link-adaptation indicators among other clusters, and
yields a ``core'' performance measure set for future learning-driven O-RAN
testing.

*Yupeng Li,Ruhao Zhang,Yitong Liu,Chunju Shao,Jing Jin,Shijian Gao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种基于DDPM的双重应用信道估计算法，结合数据去噪和增强功能，在精度和计算成本之间实现优越平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原始信号在导频位置的严重噪声问题，以及深度学习网络训练需要大量数据的问题

Method: 采用无监督结构清理现场数据，通过调整反向步骤生成新信道数据，并提出分段前向策略处理不同SNR

Result: 链路级仿真表明该方案在精度和计算成本之间实现了比现有基准更优越的权衡

Conclusion: DDPM在信道估计中具有双重应用潜力，既能去噪又能数据增强，且提出的分段前向策略有效提高了收敛精度

Abstract: This letter introduces a dual application of denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM)-based channel estimation algorithm integrating data
denoising and augmentation. Denoising addresses the severe noise in raw signals
at pilot locations, which can impair channel estimation accuracy. An
unsupervised structure is proposed to clean field data without prior knowledge
of pure channel information. Data augmentation is crucial due to the
data-intensive nature of training deep learning (DL) networks for channel state
information (CSI) estimation. The network generates new channel data by
adjusting reverse steps, enriching the training dataset. To manage varying
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in communication data, a piecewise forward
strategy is proposed to enhance the DDPM convergence precision. The link-level
simulations indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a superior tradeoff
between precision and computational cost compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方案推进了实际多标签环境中可扩展、可靠的环境反向散射定位技术。

Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low-power indoor localization system based on
Zero-Energy Devices (ZEDs) has shown promising results in ambient backscatter
communication. In this paper, we study detection of multiple coexisting ZEDs in
ambient backscatter systems under interference and synchronization uncertainty.
Building on a Neyman-Pearson (NP) formulation previously applied to single-tag
detection, we introduce a detector tailored to multi-tag scenarios. The core
idea is to use a Near-Perfect Code (NPC) as the synchronization sequence, which
substantially improves the peak-to-sidelobe (PSL) ratio and thus separability
among concurrent tags. The proposed scheme replaces dual band-pass filtering
with dual correlators, enabling an explicit Bayesian detector and tight control
of the false-alarm rate; we further incorporate a contrast metric and
multi-frequency combining to reveal secondary tags. Experiments on the
CorteXlab testbed (part of the SLICES-EU infrastructure) confirm robustness at
low SNR, with observed PSL improvements from about 11 dB to about 22 dB. These
results advance scalable, reliable ambient backscatter localization in
practical multi-tag environments.

Abstract: The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra large-scale multiple-input
multiple-output (XL-MIMO), is emerging as a key enabler for future
communication systems. Thanks to the advent of new spectrum resources and
degrees of freedom brought by the near-field propagation, the mid-band XL-MIMO
system is expected to significantly enhance throughput and inherently support
advanced functionalities such as integrated sensing and communication. Although
theoretical studies have highlighted the benefits of mid-band XL-MIMO systems,
the promised performance gains have yet to be validated in practical systems,
posing a major challenge to the standardization. In this paper, preliminaries
are first discussed, followed by an analysis of key challenges in constructing
a real-time prototype system. Subsequently, the design and implementation of a
real-time mid-band XL-MIMO prototype system are presented. Benefiting from the
novel architecture, the proposed prototype system supports metrics aligned with
standardization, including a bandwidth of 200 MHz, up to 1024 antenna elements,
and up to 256 transceiver chains. Operating in time-division duplexing (TDD)
mode, the prototype enables multiuser communication with support for up to 12
users, while retaining standard communication procedures. Built on
software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, the system is programmable and allows
for flexible deployment of advanced algorithms. Moreover, the modular
architecture ensures high scalability, making the system adaptable to various
configurations, including distributed deployments and decentralized signal
processing. Experimental results with the proposed prototype system demonstrate
real-time digital sample processing at 1167.85 Gbps, a peak data throughput of
15.81 Gbps for 12 users, and a maximal spectral efficiency approaching 80
bit/s/Hz.

Abstract: In this correspondence, a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
framework is proposed to accomplish data communication, vehicle positioning,
and environment sensing simultaneously in a cellular vehicular network. By
incorporating the vehicle positioning problem with the existing
computational-imaging-based ISAC models, we formulate a special integrated
sensing, communication, and positioning problem in which the unknowns are
highly coupled. To mitigate the rank deficiency and make it solvable, we
discretize the region of interest (ROI) into sensing and positioning pixels
respectively, and exploit both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
propagation of the vehicles' uplink access signals. The resultant problem is
shown to be a polynomial bilinear compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction
problem, which is then solved by the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to
iteratively achieve symbol detection, vehicle positioning and environment
sensing. Performance analysis and numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between nerve anatomy and the functional
outcomes of electrical stimulation is critical for optimizing neural interface
design. In this study, we conducted acute experiments on four pigs in which
epineural cuff electrodes with multiple contacts were placed around upper limb
nerves. A subset of electrical stimulation configurations -- previously
identified via computational study -- was applied, and the resulting evoked
electromyographic (EMG) responses were recorded from target muscles. Muscle
recruitment curves were extracted and analysed offline to quantify activation
patterns. Following the electrophysiological experiments, the stimulated nerves
were harvested and processed for histological analysis to visualize fascicular
organization and distribution. This work presents preliminary results from the
combined analysis of muscle activation profiles and fascicle anatomy in one
animal. Our findings aim to inform the design of stimulation strategies by
linking electrode configuration to selective muscle recruitment, ultimately
contributing to more effective neuromodulation and neuroprosthetic
applications.

Result: 数值仿真验证表明，Inc-GAN能够基于实际列车运营中收集的测量数据准确预测电场，与传统方法相比显著提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于实际运营数据的铁路通信系统优化提供了一种新颖解决方案。

Abstract: High-speed railway tunnel communication systems require reliable radio wave
propagation prediction to ensure operational safety. However, conventional
simulation methods face challenges of high computational complexity and
inability to effectively process sparse measurement data collected during
actual railway operations. This letter proposes an inception-enhanced
generative adversarial network (Inc-GAN) that can reconstruct complete electric
field distributions across tunnel cross-sections using sparse value lines
measured during actual train operations as input. This directly addresses
practical railway measurement constraints. Through an inception-based generator
architecture and progressive training strategy, the method achieves robust
reconstruction from single measurement signal lines to complete field
distributions. Numerical simulation validation demonstrates that Inc-GAN can
accurately predict electric fields based on measured data collected during
actual train operations, with significantly improved computational efficiency
compared to traditional methods, providing a novel solution for railway
communication system optimization based on real operational data.

*Dexin Wang,Isha Jariwala,Ahmad Bazzi,Sundeep Rangan,Theodore S. Rappaport,Marwa Chafii*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ADMM的压缩多频带感知方法(ADMM-CMS)，用于6G集成感知与通信中的用户和散射体联合检测与定位，相比传统方法具有更高的空间分辨率和去噪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多频带感知方法受限于经典波束成形或计算复杂度高的方法，需要开发更高效的联合检测与定位技术来支持6G集成感知与通信。

Method: 使用ADMM算法解决压缩多频带感知问题，开发了自适应ADMM算法，能够根据噪声调整并确保自动停止收敛，结合了对偶上升的可分解性和增广拉格朗日方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 相比Bartlett型波束成形，ADMM-CMS实现了更高的空间分辨率和改进的去噪性能，在达到0.9成功恢复概率时，每天线发射功率增益达34 dB；相比在7 GHz和10 GHz子频带上分别进行压缩感知，延迟均方根误差分别降低35%和38.1%。

Conclusion: ADMM-CMS是6G系统在FR3频段(7-24 GHz)实现集成感知与通信的高效使能技术。

Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich
channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical
beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed
multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel
framework for multiband sensing using uplink QAM-modulated pilot symbols. To
solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to
noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the
decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian
methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization.
Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved
denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in
per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability
(SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the
constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay
root mean squared error of 35% and 38.1%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna
transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate
ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz)
for 6G systems.

### [10] [A Study of Neural Polar Decoders for Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03069)
*Rom Hirsch,Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister,Haim H. Permuter*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 将神经极化解码器(NPD)应用于真实通信系统，在5G信道中相比标准5G极化解码器在BER、BLER和吞吐量方面表现更优，特别适用于低速率和短块配置的控制信道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将先前在合成信道中验证有效的NPD扩展到真实通信系统，满足实际系统需求，包括支持任意码长、高阶调制和多样化信道条件。

Method: 将NPD适配到完整的OFDM和单载波通信系统，通过速率匹配支持任意码长，直接在有记忆的信道上运行，利用信道结构实现更高数据速率，无需导频和循环前缀。

Result: 在5G信道上的实验结果表明，NPD在BER、BLER和吞吐量方面持续优于5G极化解码器，特别是在低速率和短块配置下改进显著。单载波系统的NPD性能与OFDM相当但具有更低的PAPR。

Conclusion: NPD是一种高性能、无导频且鲁棒的解码解决方案，适用于实际通信系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for
end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the
effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to
real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and
single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements,
the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order
modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates
directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher
data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails
higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural
network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics,
resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental
results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the
5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are
particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are
prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier
systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling
effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position
the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.

Abstract: We study time difference of arrival (TDoA)-based algorithms for drone
controller localization and analyze TDoA estimation in multipath channels.
Building on TDoA estimation, we propose two algorithms to enhance localization
accuracy in multipath environments: the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and
the Least Squares Bancroft with Gauss-Newton (LS-BF-GN) algorithm. We evaluate
these proposed algorithms in two typical outdoor channels: Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) Channel F and the two-ray ground reflection (TRGR) channel. Our
simulation results demonstrate that the ML and LS-BF-GN algorithms
significantly outperform the LS-BF algorithm in multipath channels. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we propose averaging multiple tentative location
estimations. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of time synchronization
errors among sensors on localization performance through simulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming
attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that
uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers,
enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver,
we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity
variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known
jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme
to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to
dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive
communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent
phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we
develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of
jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the
jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the
proposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method.
Simulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed
anti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks
across a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios.

### [13] [Engineering Emergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02649)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文扩展了因果涌现理论，分析了系统多尺度结构中的因果贡献，提出了因果顶部重、底部重或复杂层次结构的分类，并提供了量化这种复杂性的数学工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统的复杂性源于其多尺度结构，但现有理论主要关注单一尺度路径，需要更全面地分析系统所有尺度的因果贡献。

Method: 扩展因果涌现理论(2.0)，分析系统完整多尺度结构而非单一尺度路径的因果贡献，开发量化工具来分类系统的涌现层次结构。

Conclusion: 提出的数学工具能够量化系统多尺度结构的复杂性，为理解复杂系统的涌现层次提供了更精确的分析框架。

Abstract: One of the reasons complex systems are complex is because they have
multiscale structure. How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue
that it reflects an emergent hierarchy of scales that contribute to the
system's causal workings. An example is how a computer can be described at the
level of its hardware circuitry but also its software. But we show that many
systems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small
subset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the
theory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions
across the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single
path that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be
classified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent
hierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific
notion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the
scales of a system) than the standard network science terminology. More
broadly, we provide the mathematical tools to quantify this complexity and
provide diverse examples of the taxonomy of emergent hierarchies. Finally, we
demonstrate the ability to engineer not just degree of emergence in a system,
but how that emergence is distributed across the multiscale structure.

Abstract: We consider downlink broadcast design for federated learning (FL) in a
wireless network with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Aiming to
reduce transmission latency, we propose a segmented analog broadcast (SegAB)
scheme, where the parameter server, hosted by a multi-antenna base station,
partitions the global model parameter vector into segments and transmits
multiple parameters from these segments simultaneously over a common downlink
channel. We formulate the SegAB transmission and reception processes to
characterize FL training convergence, capturing the effects of downlink
beamforming and imperfect CSI. To maximize the FL training convergence rate, we
establish an upper bound on the expected model optimality gap and show that it
can be minimized separately over the training rounds in online optimization,
without requiring knowledge of the future channel states. We solve the
per-round problem to achieve robust downlink beamforming, by minimizing the
worst-case objective via an epigraph representation and a feasibility
subproblem that ensures monotone convergence. Simulation with standard
classification tasks under typical wireless network setting shows that the
proposed SegAB substantially outperforms conventional full-model per-parameter
broadcast and other alternatives.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ambient Internet of Things
(AIoT) devices to achieve ultra-low-power, low-cost, and massive connectivity.
Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter
device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol
timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR
activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR.
Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source
renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in
AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol
detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio
frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to
induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a
pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot
signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and
evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the
proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates
the BER performance degradation caused by STO.

Conclusion: 事件视觉传感器为相位恢复提供了一种时间高效且稳定的强度信息获取方法，特别适用于低光照环境下的准确相位恢复。

Abstract: To time-efficiently and stably acquire the intensity information for phase
retrieval under a coherent illumination, we leverage an event-based vision
sensor (EVS) that can detect changes in logarithmic intensity at the pixel
level with a wide dynamic range. In our optical system, we translate the EVS
along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by
defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial
differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which
presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase
distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more
advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably
detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate
phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.

<details>

Motivation: 选择适合容错计算的纠错码具有挑战性，因为除了速率和距离外，编码还需要便于访问编码信息以支持编码数据的计算，这与拥有大速率和距离似乎存在冲突。

Result: 证明编码家族不能同时具备恒定速率、增长距离和执行编码CNOT门的短深度门电路。

Conclusion: 在容错计算中，实现良好速率和距离可能需要接受非常深的电路，这在某些架构和应用中是不理想的权衡。

Abstract: Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata
Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty
circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code
is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of
the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the
fault-tolerant circuit, while increasing the distance of the code ensures
robustness against faults. If the rate and distance were the only concerns, we
could use asymptotically optimal codes as is done in communication settings.
However, choosing a code for computation is challenging due to an additional
requirement: The code needs to facilitate accessibility of encoded information
to enable computation on encoded data. This seems to conflict with having large
rate and distance. We prove that this is indeed the case, namely that a code
family cannot simultaneously have constant rate, growing distance and
short-depth gadgets to perform encoded CNOT gates. As a consequence, achieving
good rate and distance may necessarily entail accepting very deep circuits, an
undesirable trade-off in certain architectures and applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码稀疏化是图论中割稀疏化概念在编码理论中的类比。最近的研究表明线性码存在大小为n/2+O(√kn)的单边1/2稀疏化器，但计算最小稀疏化器的复杂度未知。

Method: 通过从经典的最近码字问题归约，证明寻找最小单边1/2稀疏化器是NP难的。

Result: 证明了寻找最小尺寸的单边1/2稀疏化器是NP难问题，并给出了近似难度结果。

Conclusion: 计算最小单边1/2稀疏化器是计算困难的问题，这为代码稀疏化的计算复杂性提供了理论界限。

Abstract: The notion of code sparsification was introduced by Khanna, Putterman and
Sudan (arxiv.2311.00788), as an analogue to the the more established notion of
cut sparsification in graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, for $\alpha\in
(0,1)$ an (unweighted) one-sided $\alpha$-sparsifier for a linear code
$\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ such that
the weight of each codeword projected onto the coordinates in $S$ is preserved
up to an $\alpha$ fraction. Recently, Gharan and Sahami (arxiv.2502.02799) show
the existence of one-sided 1/2-sparsifiers of size $n/2+O(\sqrt{kn})$ for any
linear code, where $k$ is the dimension of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we
consider the computational problem of finding a one-sided 1/2-sparsifier of
minimal size, and show that it is NP-hard, via a reduction from the classical
nearest codeword problem. We also show hardness of approximation results.

Result: 在ImageNet数据库上学习的IEM在预测人类感知判断方面与最先进的监督图像质量度量相当或更优。

Conclusion: IEM是一种有效的全局度量，能够自适应复杂分布的几何特性，在图像质量评估等应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of
distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density
over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship
between information theory and estimation theory, which links the
log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to
noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of
signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of
noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector
fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.
We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form
expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian
metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the
Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both
locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM
can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion
models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our
framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this
IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image
quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Abstract: High-resolution infrared imagers are currently more expensive than CMOS and
CCD cameras, due to costly sensor arrays. Van der Waals (vdWs) materials
present an opportunity for low-cost, room temperature infrared photodetectors.
Although photodetectors based on vdWs materials show promising performance,
creating a megapixel array is yet to be achieved. Imaging with a single vdWs
photodetector typically relies on time-consuming mechanical scanning and
suffers from low resolution. Single pixel imaging (SPI) offers an affordable
alternative to achieve high-resolution imaging, utilizing only one
photodetector and a spatial light modulator. Progress in SPI using vdWs
material photodetectors has been limited, with only one prior demonstration in
the near infrared range (64$\times$64 pixels). In this work, we demonstrate a
high-resolution SPI system (1023$\times$768 for visible light and
512$\times$512 for extended shortwave infrared) using a black
phosphorus-molybdenum disulfide (bP-MoS$_2$) photodiode, surpassing earlier
vdWs material SPI implementations by a factor of 64 in pixel count. We
introduce an easy-to-implement edge detection method for rapid feature
extraction. We employ compressed sampling and reduce imaging time by a factor
of four. Our compressed sampling approach is based on a cyclic S-matrix, which
is derived from a Hadamard-based sequence, where each row is a circular shift
of the first row. This enables efficient imaging reconstruction via circular
convolution and Fourier transforms, allowing fewer measurements while
preserving the key image features. Our method for SPI using a vdWs material
photodetector presents the opportunity for inexpensive shortwave infrared and
midwave infrared cameras, and thus may enable advances in gas detection,
biomedical imaging, autonomous driving, security, and surveillance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared
(VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The
dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic
surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and
fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall
Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an
altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands
spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and
mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point
Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC
spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE
values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm
range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside
raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support
reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access
UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor
benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on
pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color
transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method
dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a
high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed
pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving
superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves
transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then
reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of
the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB
colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and
reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively
estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including
image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low
computational complexity and small model size.

Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes
of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as
anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the
degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision
loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD
or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to
reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,
deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and
GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in
distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI
driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists
regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works
mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying
causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific
factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a
novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified
CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT
images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal
inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major
risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent
causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through
GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD
causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for
various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.
