Abstract: Distributed wireless clock synchronization is essential for aligning the
clocks of distributed transceivers in support of joint transmission and
reception techniques. One recently explored method involves synchronizing
distributed transceivers using a two-tone waveform, where the tones are
separated in frequency by a clock (frequency) reference signal. Prior research
has demonstrated frequency accuracy better than 1 Hz; however, this approach
remains vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional interference. In this
demonstration, we present a robust, frequency-hopped two-tone waveform that
enables transceivers to extract the reference signal without prior knowledge of
the exact frequency at which the tones are transmitted.

Abstract: This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO
cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base
station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable
simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation
between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we
formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to
jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem
is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a
graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is
developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect
channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be
deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To
further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array
(FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the
communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach,
while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of
FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.

Conclusion: 2×4 MIMO配置为O-RAN发展提供了有效的性能改进基础，证明了在5G系统中扩展天线配置的可行性。

Abstract: We present the first-of-a-kind closed-loop $2\times4$ MIMO implementation for
the downlink of 5G Open RAN using OpenAirInterface (OAI), which is capable of
transmitting up to two transmission layers. Our implementation is a fully
functional 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including the 5G Core Network (5G CN),
5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN), as well as 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This
serves as a foundational framework for further advancements in the context of
emerging Open RAN (O-RAN) development. A key feature of our implementation is
the enhanced Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure at the UE,
which includes Rank Indicator (RI), Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI), and
Channel Quality Indicator (CQI). It is adjusted for the extended configuration
to maximize data rates. To demonstrate the performance of our implementation,
we measure the downlink data rates using $\textit{iperf3}$ in two scenarios:
(i) fixed channels to assess two-layer data transmission and (ii)
$\textit{Rice1}$ channels for general transmission analysis. The obtained
simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the existing $2\times2$ MIMO
configuration in the OAI, our implementation improves the data rates in almost
all scenarios, especially at the high Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs).

Abstract: We present the first implementation of a Multi-User Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) transmission scheme on the Physical Downlink Shared
Channel (PDSCH) for 5G Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) based on
OpenAirInterface (OAI). Our implementation features a fully functional
O-RAN-compliant 5G New Radio (5G NR) system, including a 5G Core Network (5G
CN), a refined 5G RAN, which is split into a Centre Unit (CU) and an
Distributed Unit (DU), and 5G NR User Equipment (UEs). This implementation
demonstrates MU-MIMO performance in the downlink while showcasing the
disaggregation capabilities of O-RAN. Specifically, the Base Station (i.e. gNB)
in our setup is capable of serving two UEs simultaneously over the same
downlink Resource Block (RBs). User scheduling is performed based on the
Precoding Matrix Indicators (PMIs) reported by the UEs according to the NR
Channel State Information (CSI) reporting procedure. The system throughput
performance is evaluated using $\textit{iperf}$. The obtained results via
simulation and testbed experiments demonstrate that the MU-MIMO scheme achieves
significant downlink throughput gains, particularly in the high
Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) regime, while keeping the Block Error Rate (BLER)
below the required threshold of $10^{-1}$ for both UEs.

Abstract: Networks exploiting distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC)
nodes can provide enhanced localization and sensing performance, further
emphasized when operating with large arrays and bandwidths available in the
upper mid-band (also known as FR3). In this paper, we consider a DISAC system
operating at FR3 where a single base station (BS) acts as the transmitter and
several vehicular user equipments (UEs) act as the receivers. We tackle the
design of the signal processing chain at the UE side to enable joint UE
positioning and target localization. The system model exploits a
multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) waveform, and incorporates practical effects such as inter-node
timing offsets (TOs), extended targets, dense multipath, and realistic uniform
planar arrays (UPAs) at both ends. The proposed design includes a multipath
estimation stage at each UE, clutter removal, a novel clustering and
association scheme, and a final joint estimator of UE positions and target
locations. The estimator solves a weighted least squares (WLS) problem to
jointly compute clock offsets and localize UEs and targets. Numerical results
considering two UEs and two targets show that for 80\% of the cases the target
localization error is below 32cm, while the UE positioning error is below 44cm.

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in
wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D)
boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new
RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum
sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary
communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the
joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at
the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR),
while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and
the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated
problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables,
we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO)
and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality
solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system
substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR
systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication
quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of electronic information technology, the number
and variety of unknown radiation sources have increased significantly. Some of
these sources share common characteristics, which offers the potential to
effectively address the challenge of identifying unknown radiation sources.
However, research on the classification of radiation sources remains relatively
limited. This paper proposes a big data analysis method that combines linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) with a rough neighborhood set (NRS) for radiation
source classification, and its effectiveness is validated on the RadioML 2018
dataset. The results indicate that, under certain constraints, all modulation
types can be categorized into four distinct classes, laying a foundation for
further research on cognitive interference signal cancellation.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的神经网络架构，用于在稀疏历史测量条件下预测多天线阵列和多频段的可达速率，以改善频段选择决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着FR3等新频段的扩展，用户设备需要在有限尺寸内支持多频段多天线。信道质量快速变化、天线视场角有限以及硬件功率限制导致的测量稀疏性，给可靠的多频段信道跟踪带来挑战。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的神经网络架构，输入异步速率历史数据，输出每个天线阵列的速率预测。

Result: 在密集城市微蜂窝场景的射线追踪仿真中，该方法在FR1和FR3阵列上表现出优于基线预测器的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在现实的移动性和硬件约束下实现更明智的频段选择。

Abstract: Cellular wireless systems are witnessing the proliferation of frequency bands
over a wide spectrum, particularly with the expansion of new bands in FR3.
These bands must be supported in user equipment (UE) handsets with multiple
antennas in a constrained form factor. Rapid variations in channel quality
across the bands from motion and hand blockage, limited field-of-view of
antennas, and hardware and power-constrained measurement sparsity pose
significant challenges to reliable multi-band channel tracking. This paper
formulates the problem of predicting achievable rates across multiple antenna
arrays and bands with sparse historical measurements. We propose a
transformer-based neural architecture that takes asynchronous rate histories as
input and outputs per-array rate predictions. Evaluated on ray-traced
simulations in a dense urban micro-cellular setting with FR1 and FR3 arrays,
our method demonstrates superior performance over baseline predictors, enabling
more informed band selection under realistic mobility and hardware constraints.

### [9] [Doppler-Based Multistatic Drone Tracking via Cellular Downlink Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25732)
*Chenqing Ji,Qionghui Liu,Jiahong Liu,Chao Yu,Yifei Sun,Rui Wang,Fan Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用LTE下行信号的多基地多普勒传感系统进行无人机跟踪，仅通过多普勒频率测量就能实现高精度轨迹重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用现有的LTE基站作为信号源，通过被动接收器检测多普勒频率，实现无需距离和角度测量的无人机跟踪。

Method: 部署三个被动传感接收器在不同位置，从接收的LTE下行信号中检测目标无人机的双基地多普勒频率，通过求解最小均方误差问题重构轨迹。

Result: 实验显示，虽然目标无人机和所有接收器距离LTE基站约200米，但复杂轨迹的跟踪误差90%低于90厘米，精度显著高于LTE信号的典型距离分辨率。

Conclusion: 仅依靠多普勒检测就能实现高精度无人机轨迹跟踪，前提是接收器部署密度足够高。

Abstract: In this paper, a multistatic Doppler sensing system is proposed for the drone
tracking via downlink Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signals. Specifically, the LTE
base stations (BSs) are exploited as signal illuminators, and three passive
sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic
Doppler frequencies of a target drone from received downlink signals. It is
shown that even without the measurements of BS-drone-receiver range and angle,
the Doppler measurements could provide sufficient information for trajectory
tracking. Particularly, the trajectory of the target drone, consisting of the
initial position and velocities of all the time slots, can be reconstructed by
solving a minimum mean-squared error problem according to the above Doppler
measurements. It is demonstrated by experiment that although the target drone
and all the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating
BSs, the complicated trajectories can be tracked with 90% errors below 90
centimeters. Since this accuracy is notably higher than the typical range
resolution of LTE signals, the demonstration shows that drone trajectory
tracking with a high accuracy could be feasible solely according to Doppler
detection, as long as the deployment density of receivers is sufficiently high.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出利用站点特定数字孪生来辅助训练基于深度学习的CSI压缩模型，通过电磁3D模型、硬件模型和射线追踪生成合成CSI数据，减少对真实测量数据的依赖。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in
compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing
feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their
reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection
incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To
address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the
training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an
electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray
tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be
trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further
develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into
four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware
modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data
and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments,
we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of
real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin
dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital
twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed
refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world
data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity,
especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving
CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights
into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin
development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种高速铁路场景下的延迟-多普勒域信道测量和建模方法，通过LTE-R系统测量验证了DD域信道模型的准确性，并发现DD域信道衰落系数的准不变区间比准平稳区间小得多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代无线通信系统需要在高频段和高移动性场景下运行，而传统的信道建模方法主要局限于时域、频域和空间域，DD域信道建模原理研究不足。

Method: 设计了基于LTE-R系统的DD域信道测量方法，研究了准平稳区间、多径分量统计功率建模以及DD域信道衰落系数的准不变区间。

Result: 在371 km/h的LTE-R测量中建立了不同信道时变条件下的DD域信道模型，验证了模型准确性，并发现DD域信道衰落系数的准不变区间在毫秒量级，远小于准平稳区间的100毫秒量级。

Conclusion: 该研究可为高移动性环境中的DD域建模提供理论指导，支持未来6G及以上的DDMC和集成感知通信设计。

Abstract: As next-generation wireless communication systems need to be able to operate
in high-frequency bands and high-mobility scenarios, delay-Doppler (DD) domain
multicarrier (DDMC) modulation schemes, such as orthogonal time frequency space
(OTFS), demonstrate superior reliability over orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM). Accurate DD domain channel modeling is essential for DDMC
system design. However, since traditional channel modeling approaches are
mainly confined to time, frequency, and space domains, the principles of DD
domain channel modeling remain poorly studied. To address this issue, we
propose a systematic DD domain channel measurement and modeling methodology in
high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios. First, we design a DD domain channel
measurement method based on the long-term evolution for railway (LTE-R) system.
Second, for DD domain channel modeling, we investigate quasi-stationary
interval, statistical power modeling of multipath components, and particularly,
the quasi-invariant intervals of DD domain channel fading coefficients. Third,
via LTE-R measurements at 371 km/h, taking the quasi-stationary interval as the
decision criterion, we establish DD domain channel models under different
channel time-varying conditions in HSR scenarios. Fourth, the accuracy of
proposed DD domain channel models is validated via bit error rate comparison of
OTFS transmission. In addition, simulation verifies that in HSR scenario, the
quasi-invariant interval of DD domain channel fading coefficient is on
millisecond (ms) order of magnitude, which is much smaller than the
quasi-stationary interval length on $100$ ms order of magnitude. This study
could provide theoretical guidance for DD domain modeling in high-mobility
environments, supporting future DDMC and integrated sensing and communication
designs for 6G and beyond.

### [12] [Closed-Form Least-Squares Design of Fast-Convolution Based Variable-Bandwidth FIR Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25931)
*Oksana Moryakova,Håkan Johansson*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于快速卷积可变带宽FIR滤波器的闭式最小二乘设计方法，该方法结合频域采样和重叠保留实现，显著降低了实现复杂度和在线带宽重配置复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可变带宽滤波器设计方法实现复杂，在线重配置困难，需要一种既能降低复杂度又能扩展可变带宽范围的设计方案。

Method: 采用频域采样和重叠保留方法，考虑线性周期时变系统的时不变脉冲响应集合，在设计中引入适当的加权函数来减少最大近似误差能量。

Result: 所提方法不仅实现了闭式设计，相比现有方案在相同性能下显著降低了复杂度，而且无需增加复杂度即可扩展可变带宽范围。

Conclusion: 该闭式最小二乘设计方法为快速卷积可变带宽FIR滤波器提供了一种高效的设计方案，在复杂度和性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper introduces a closed-form least-squares (LS) design approach for
fast-convolution (FC) based variable-bandwidth (VBW) finite-impulse-response
(FIR) filters. The proposed LS design utilizes frequency sampling and the VBW
filter frequency-domain implementation using the overlap-save (OLS) method,
that together offer significant savings in implementation and online bandwidth
reconfiguration complexities. Since combining frequency-domain design and OLS
implementation leads to a linear periodic time-varying (LPTV) behavior of the
VBW filter, a set of the corresponding time-invariant impulse responses is
considered in the proposed design. Through numerical examples, it is
demonstrated that the proposed approach enables not only closed-form design of
FC-based VBW filters with substantial complexity reductions compared to
existing solutions for a given performance, but also allows the variable
bandwidth range to be extended without any increase in complexity. Moreover, a
way of reducing the maximum approximation error energy over the whole set of
the time-invariant filters of the LPTV system is shown by introducing
appropriate weighting functions in the design.

Abstract: Satellite systems are expected to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G)
networks, providing ubiquitous coverage and supporting a wide range of services
across communications, sensing, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT).
Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is
challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey
introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which
integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling
resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed,
covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT
(JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint
communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the
state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and
outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges,
including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and
resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future
research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single
platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and
cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to
the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs)
for the 6G and beyond space era.

Abstract: Classical state estimation algorithms rely on predefined target's state-space
model, which complicates model derivation and limits adaptability when system
dynamics change. Neural network based estimators offer a data-driven
alternative, but rarely fuse classical estimation theory into their structure
and demand large, pre-computed training sets. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a unified state-space structure without target's state-space model and
treats both the input-layer activations and all network weights as latent
states to be estimated online. We instantiate this nonlinear model with three
canonical estimators-the extended Kalman estimator, the unscented Kalman
estimator, and the particle estimator to simulate different neural network and
demonstrate its generality. We then benchmark our approach against seven
leading neural network estimators across three representative scenarios.
Results show that our neural network state-space estimators not only retain the
robust learning capability, but also match or exceed the accuracy of both
classical and pre-trained neural network methods. Code, data, and more result:

### [15] [Performance Evaluation of eLoran Spatial ASF Corrections Based on Measured ASF Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26018)
*Jaewon Yu,Pyo-Woong Son*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文通过实测ASF地图评估了韩国eLoran系统中空间ASF校正方法的有效性。三种校正方案（无校正、局部校正、广域校正）的比较显示，局部校正能显著提升定位性能，而广域校正仅在参考站附近有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同ASF校正方法在eLoran系统中的定位性能，为实际系统部署提供指导。

Method: 使用实测ASF地图，在相同仿真设置下评估三种校正方案：无校正(S0)、使用真实ASF值的局部校正(S1)、使用单参考站值的广域校正(S2)。

Result: S1始终获得最低定位误差，S0误差最大且高误差区域广泛，S2仅在参考站附近有改善，随距离和ASF空间梯度增加而性能下降。

Conclusion: 局部ASF校正能显著提升eLoran定位性能，而广域校正只有局部化效益。

Abstract: This paper analyzes the effectiveness of spatial ASF correction methods in
the Korean eLoran system using measured ASF maps. Three correction scenarios
were evaluated under identical simulation settings: no correction (S0), local
correction using true ASF values (S1), and wide-area correction using a single
reference station value (S2). Simulation results show that S1 consistently
achieved the lowest positioning errors, while S0 exhibited the largest errors
with extensive high-error regions. S2 provided limited improvements near the
reference station but degraded with increasing distance and ASF spatial
gradients. The findings highlight that local ASF correction significantly
improves eLoran positioning performance, whereas wide-area correction has only
localized benefits.

TL;DR: 分析eLoran信号传播延迟与气象因素之间的相关性，研究沿信号路径不同点的传播延迟时间变化与气象条件的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: eLoran系统具有高场强优势，在GNSS不可用时仍能可靠运行，但其地面波传播延迟易受地表条件（包括地形和气象变化）影响，需要研究气象因素对传播延迟的具体影响。

Method: 分析eLoran信号传播路径上不同点的传播延迟时间变化与气象因素之间的相关性。

Result: 研究发现eLoran信号传播延迟存在时间变化，这些变化与沿信号路径的气象因素具有相关性。

Conclusion: 气象因素是影响eLoran信号传播延迟的重要变量，理解这种相关性对于提高eLoran系统的定位精度和可靠性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Unlike GNSS, which is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing due to its
inherently weak received power, eLoran exhibits robustness owing to its high
field strength. Therefore, the eLoran system can maintain reliable operation
even in scenarios where GNSS becomes unavailable. However, since eLoran signals
propagate through ground waves, the propagation delay is susceptible to changes
in surface conditions, including both terrain and meteorological variations.
This study aims to analyze the correlation between the temporal variations in
eLoran signal propagation delay and meteorological factors at various points
along the signal path.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的车联网通信系统能够有效支持应急车辆和普通车辆的不同通信需求，通过联合优化轨迹和资源分配实现更好的性能。

Abstract: Effective communication for emergency vehicles - such as ambulances and fire
trucks - is essential to support their operations in various traffic and
environmental conditions. In this context, this paper investigates a vehicular
communication system assisted by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which
adjusts its trajectory and resource allocation according to communication
needs. The system classifies vehicles into two groups to address their varying
service requirements: emergency vehicles, which require a minimum instantaneous
data rate to access critical information timely, and normal vehicles. To
support both categories effectively, this paper proposes a joint optimization
approach that coordinates UAV trajectory planning and Dynamic Bandwidth
Allocation (DBA). The objective is to maximize the minimum average data rate
for normal vehicles while ensuring that emergency vehicles maintain an
instantaneous rate above a predefined threshold. This approach takes into
account some system constraints, including UAV propulsion power consumption,
mobility limitations, and backhaul capacity. To tackle the resulting non-convex
problem, an iterative optimization method is employed, where the original
problem is decomposed into two subproblems: bandwidth allocation and UAV
trajectory design. In each iteration, the trajectory subproblem is solved using
the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Numerical results confirm
that the proposed solution achieves superior performance in meeting service
requirements compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)
framework for multi-user systems with multiple communication users (CUs) and
adversarial targets, where the design problem is formulated to maximize secrecy
rate under joint sensing and communication constraints. An efficient solution
is presented based on an accelerated fractional programming method using a
non-homogeneous complex quadratic transform (QT), which decomposes the problem
into tractable subproblems for beamforming and artificial noise (AN)
optimization. Unlike conventional artificial noise strategies, the proposed
approach also exploits AN to enhance sensing while avoiding interference with
legitimate users. Simulation results show significant gains in secrecy rate,
communication reliability, and sensing accuracy, confirming the effectiveness

Result: 定量和定性评估显示FinGAN生成的合成RSS数据与真实数据高度一致，定位性能与完整真实数据集相当，在三个典型办公环境数据集上表现一致。

Conclusion: FinGAN能够准确生成未测量参考点的RSS数据，在不同场景下具有良好泛化能力，为RSS指纹数据集扩展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces FinGAN, a robust received signal strength (RSS) data
generator designed to expand RSS fingerprint datasets. Compared to existing
generative adversarial models that either rely on known reference positions
(RPs) or depend on predefined priors, FinGAN learns the latent information
between RPs and RSS values by maximizing the mutual information between the
generated RSS data and the RPs, enabling an end-to-end RSS generation directly
from RPs. This allows us to accurately generate RSS data for previously
unmeasured RPs. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that
FinGAN produces synthetic RSS data closely aligned with real RSS sample
collected from the on-site experiment, preserving localization performance
comparable to that achieved with complete real-world datasets. To further
validate its generalizability, FinGAN is also trained and evaluated on
open-source datasets from three typical office environments,and the results
demonstrate consistent performance across different scenarios.

Motivation: 在MISO下行无线网络中，传统加权和速率最大化方法未能充分考虑用户速率的可靠性，特别是在信道衰落不确定性下的尾部风险。需要一种能够确保速率(超)可靠性的方法。

Method: 引入风险聚合的WSR最大化问题，利用CVaR作为函数来强制速率可靠性；建立WMMSE类等价关系；设计专门的展开图神经网络(αRGNN)策略函数逼近，训练以最大化由不利信道实现产生的尾部(CVaR)速率。

Result: 经验证明，训练后的αRGNN完全消除了每个用户的深度速率衰落，显著且最优地降低了统计用户速率变异性，同时保持了足够的遍历性能。

Conclusion: 提出的αRGNN方法有效解决了MISO下行链路中的速率可靠性问题，通过风险感知的预编码策略实现了对深度衰落和速率变异性的鲁棒控制。

Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing weighted sum rate in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) downlink wireless network with emphasis on user rate
reliability. We introduce a novel risk-aggregated formulation of the complex
WSR maximization problem, which utilizes the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)
as a functional for enforcing rate (ultra)-reliability over channel fading
uncertainty/risk. We establish a WMMSE-like equivalence between the proposed
precoding problem and a weighted risk-averse MSE problem, enabling us to design
a tailored unfolded graph neural network (GNN) policy function approximation
(PFA), named {\alpha}-Robust Graph Neural Network ({\alpha}RGNN), trained to
maximize lower-tail (CVaR) rates resulting from adverse wireless channel
realizations (e.g., deep fading, attenuation). We empirically demonstrate that
a trained {\alpha}RGNN fully eliminates per user deep rate fades, and
substantially and optimally reduces statistical user rate variability while
retaining adequate ergodic performance.

Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) have emerged as
a promising technology for 6G wireless networks, offering more advanced control
over electromagnetic wave propagation than conventional diagonal RIS. This
paper proposes a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework
that incorporates BD-RIS at the transmitter. This not only opens the door to
enhanced sensing and communication performance, but also alleviates the need
for large-scale fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains at the transmitter.
Based on the proposed system model, we formulate a normalized weighted
optimization problem to jointly design the active beamforming and the BD-RIS
scattering matrix with the aim of jointly minimizing the trace of the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing targets and maximizing the sum rate (SR)
for communication users. To address this highly coupled optimization problem,
we propose a novel and low-complexity iterative algorithm that efficiently
solves the active beamforming and scattering matrix subproblems by transforming
each into a series of tractable projection problems with closed-form solutions.
Numerical results show the appealing capability of the transmitter-side
BD-RIS-aided ISAC over conventional diagonal RIS-aided ISAC in enhancing both
sensing and communication performance. Moreover, compared to the classic
iterative algorithm, the proposed algorithm offers enhanced dual-functional
performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

Conclusion: 所提出的物理信息多源域自适应框架显著提升了震后损伤评估能力，解决了标注数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Efficient and intelligent assessment of post-earthquake structural damage is
critical for rapid disaster response. While data-driven approaches have shown
promise, traditional supervised learning methods rely on extensive labeled
datasets, which are often impractical to obtain for damaged structures. To
address this limitation, we propose a physics-informed multi-source domain
adaptation framework to predict post-earthquake structural damage for a target
building without requiring damage labels. The multi-source domain integrates
actual damage data and numerical modeling data from buildings similar to the
target structure. The framework operates through three key steps. First, the
similarity of key physics from each domain are analyzed to form a weight
matrix, which enhances domain differentiation. Second, features from the
multi-source and target domains are extracted and fed into a classifier and a
discriminator. The classifier ensures that the features are damage-sensitive
and accurately assign damage states, while the discriminator enforces that the
features remain domain-invariant. Finally, the key parameters matrix is applied
as weights during adversarial training to optimize the contribution of features
from each source domain. The proposed framework provides a robust solution for
assessing structural damage in scenarios where labeled data is scarce,
significantly advancing the capabilities of post-earthquake damage evaluation.

existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the
minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be
used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound)
shedding new light on this long debated subject.

Conclusion: GNSS信号为室内外分类提供了可靠特征，多模态数据融合方法在频谱共享应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: The desirability of the mid-band frequency range (1 - 10 GHz) for federal and
commercial applications, combined with the growing applications for commercial
indoor use-cases, such as factory automation, opens up a new approach to
spectrum sharing: the same frequency bands used outdoors by federal incumbents
can be reused by commercial indoor users. A recent example of such sharing,
between commercial systems, is the 6 GHz band (5.925 - 7.125 GHz) where
unlicensed, low-power-indoor (LPI) users share the band with outdoor
incumbents, primarily fixed microwave links. However, to date, there exist no
reliable, automatic means of determining whether a device is indoors or
outdoors, necessitating the use of other mechanisms such as mandating indoor
access points (APs) to have integrated antennas and not be battery powered, and
reducing transmit power of client devices which may be outdoors. An accurate
indoor/outdoor (I/O) classification addresses these challenges, enabling
automatic transmit power adjustments without interfering with incumbents. To
this end, we leverage the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals for
I/O classification. GNSS signals, designed inherently for outdoor reception and
highly susceptible to indoor attenuation and blocking, provide a robust and
distinguishing feature for environmental sensing. We develop various
methodologies, including threshold-based techniques and machine learning
approaches and evaluate them using an expanded dataset gathered from diverse
geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-based methods alone
can achieve greater accuracy than approaches relying solely on wireless (Wi-Fi)
data, particularly in unfamiliar locations. Furthermore, the integration of
GNSS data with Wi-Fi information leads to improved classification accuracy,
showcasing the significant benefits of multi-modal data fusion.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing
performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems.
Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target
detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are
implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped
modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme.
We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder-based system. To
improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions
from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper
bounds of the sensing and communication performance, namely the Cram\'er-Rao
bound for AoA estimation and the mutual information for communication. The
NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson
based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for
both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in
sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be
significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate
system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output to address the
improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments. Our
contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural
networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR
conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing physical-layer security
in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems by leveraging the
reconfigurability of fluid antenna systems (FAS). We propose a joint precoding

simultaneously ensuring reliable radar sensing. The problem is formulated using
fractional programming (FP) and solved through an iterative algorithm that
integrates FP transformations with successive convex approximation (SCA). To
reduce computational complexity, we further develop low-complexity schemes
based on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, combined with greedy port selection and
trace-inverse minimization. Simulation results demonstrate substantial
improvements in both secrecy performance and sensing accuracy compared to
conventional baselines, across a wide range of FAS ports, user loads, and
sensing targets. These findings highlight the critical importance of FAS
geometry optimization in enabling secure and efficient joint

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFAR检测算法将扩展目标的多个散射点视为独立检测，丢弃了目标固有的空间散射结构信息。为了保留这种散射分布特征，需要开发新的检测框架。

Method: 设计Range-Doppler分割框架封装汽车目标的典型散射轮廓，使用最大似然估计和Gibbs MCMC采样进行统计建模，基于估计模型推导偏度测试统计量进行二元假设分类，并集成IoU和基于峰值响应的分割中心化检测流程。

Result: 在仿真和真实数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法在汽车雷达应用中具有改进的检测精度，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法适合汽车雷达应用，通过更好地保留目标散射结构特征，显著提高了检测准确性。

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar systems, owing to their large bandwidth,
provide fine range resolution that enables the observation of multiple
scatterers originating from a single automotive target commonly referred to as
an extended target. Conventional CFAR-based detection algorithms typically
treat these scatterers as independent detections, thereby discarding the
spatial scattering structure intrinsic to the target. To preserve this
scattering spread, this paper proposes a Range-Doppler (RD) segment framework
designed to encapsulate the typical scattering profile of an automobile. The
statistical characterization of the segment is performed using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and posterior density modeling facilitated through
Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. A skewness-based test
statistic, derived from the estimated statistical model, is introduced for
binary hypothesis classification of extended targets. Additionally, the paper
presents a detection pipeline that incorporates Intersection over Union (IoU)
and segment centering based on peak response, optimized to work within a single
dwell. Extensive evaluations using both simulated and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, underscoring its
suitability for automotive radar applications through improved detection
accuracy.

Abstract: Diffractive optical element based background oriented schlieren (BOS) is a
popular technique for quantitative flow visualization. This technique relies on
encoding spatial density variations of the test medium in the form of an

even in the presence of severe noise and uneven fringe distortions in recorded

artifacts is demonstrated via rigorous numerical simulations. Furthermore, the
method's practical applicability is experimentally validated using real-world

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly used for radiographic analysis, but
their reliability is challenged by the stochastic noise inherent in clinical
imaging. A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types
impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of
state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum
(Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks:
semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel,
scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated
noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet,
DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our
results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation
models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing
under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843),
signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks
demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform.
We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as
distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under
quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to
electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models
possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far
more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores
the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the
safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.

TL;DR: 提出了位置盲ptychography这一新颖的盲逆问题，即在完全不知道扫描位置的情况下进行ptychographic相位恢复，需要同时恢复图像和扫描位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该问题源于单粒子衍射X射线成像，其中随机方向的粒子被照射并收集衍射图案。如果使用高度聚焦的X射线束，测量结果也会对每个粒子的束位置敏感，但这些位置也是未知的。

Method: 使用变分推断结合现代数据驱动的图像先验（基于分数的扩散模型），在模拟的简化2D变体中研究该困难问题的图像重建可行性。

Result: 研究发现，在正确的照明结构和强先验条件下，即使在测量噪声下，也能实现可靠且成功的图像重建，除了最困难的成像场景外都能成功。

Conclusion: 位置盲ptychography问题在适当的照明条件和强图像先验下是可行的，能够实现图像和扫描位置的联合恢复。

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

Conclusion: 通过整合PDE动力学、拓扑感知正则化和可微分求解器，为数字孪生建立了解剖结构到解剖结构生成的原理路径，具有视觉真实性、解剖排他性和拓扑一致性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from
baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that
can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing
approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant
alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is
highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic
interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring
tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction
with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant
understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded
framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with
differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class
probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion
reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and
exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion
implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly,
followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global
plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces
centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is
validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic
benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving
topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.
By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable
solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy
generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically
exclusive, and topologically consistent.

Abstract: 2D cine phase contrast (CPC) MRI provides quantitative information on blood
velocity and flow within the human vasculature. However, data acquisition is
time-consuming, motivating the reconstruction of the velocity field from
undersampled measurements to reduce scan times. In this work, we propose using
neural fields to parametrize the complex-valued images, leveraging their
inductive bias for the reconstruction of the velocity data. Additionally, to
mitigate the inherent over-smoothing of neural fields, we introduce a simple
voxel-based postprocessing step. We validate our method numerically in
Cartesian and radial k-space with both high and low temporal resolution data.
Our approach achieves accurate reconstructions at high acceleration factors,
with low errors even at 16x and 32x undersampling, and consistently outperforms
classical locally low-rank regularized voxel-based methods in both flow
estimates and anatomical depiction.

Abstract: Intra prediction is a crucial component in traditional video coding
frameworks, aiming to eliminate spatial redundancy within frames. In recent
years, an increasing number of decoder-side adaptive mode derivation methods
have been adopted into Enhanced Compression Model (ECM). However, these methods
predominantly rely on adjacent spatial information for intra mode
decision-making, overlooking potential similarity patterns in non-adjacent
spatial regions, thereby limiting intra prediction efficiency. To address this
limitation, this paper proposes a template-based intra mode derivation approach
enhanced by block vector-based prediction. The adaptive block vector
replacement strategy effectively expands the reference scope of the existing
template-based intra mode derivation mode to non-adjacent spatial information,
thereby enhancing prediction efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our strategy achieves 0.082% Bj{\o}ntegaard delta rate (BD-rate) savings for Y
components under the All Intra (AI) configuration compared to ECM-16.1 while
maintaining identical encoding/decoding complexity, and delivers an additional
0.25% BD-rate savings for Y components on screen content sequences.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix
caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and
function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise
staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,
which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent
advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis
staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge
aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in
real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI
data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and
fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for
both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates
pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using
deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,
appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and
MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our
proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI
modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks.
This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative
MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical
decision-making. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出CAP-WAE框架，通过非对称先验、边界感知正交紧致损失和方向感知序数损失，解决糖尿病视网膜病变分级中的序数性和长尾分布问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变分级具有固有的序数性和长尾分布特性，少数阶段样本稀缺、异质且临床检测至关重要。传统方法依赖各向同性高斯先验和对称损失函数，与任务的不对称性质不匹配。

Method: 使用Wasserstein自编码器(WAE)将聚合后验与非对称先验对齐，保留少数类的重尾和偏斜结构；通过边界感知正交紧致损失(MAOC)构建有序可分离的潜在空间；引入方向感知序数损失，使用轻量级头预测非对称离散度生成反映临床优先级的软标签。

Result: 在公共DR基准测试中，CAP-WAE在二次加权Kappa、准确率和宏F1分数上持续达到最先进水平，超越了序数分类和潜在生成基线方法。t-SNE可视化显示该方法将潜在流形重塑为紧凑、等级有序且重叠减少的簇。

Conclusion: CAP-WAE通过非对称先验、结构化的潜在空间和方向感知监督，有效解决了糖尿病视网膜病变分级中的序数性和长尾分布挑战，为临床关键检测提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant
mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal
illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly
contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving
therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision
transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI
tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,
attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by
leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed
model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662
images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract
diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two
pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved
accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are
outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,
recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in
the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million
(M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly
imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even
higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%,
87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable
AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping)
and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability,
providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩算法在压缩率、编码速度和解码速度之间存在权衡，缺乏统一的评估标准，难以在需要同时考虑多个性能指标的应用中选择最佳算法。

Method: 开发了一个数学模型，通过归一化和加权方案整合压缩率、编码时间和解码时间三个指标，形成统一的性能评分。

Result: 在图像和文本数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够可靠地为不同优先级设置识别最合适的压缩器。结果显示基于学习的编解码器通常提供更好的压缩率，而经典算法在速度优先时仍具优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为选择最优无损数据压缩技术提供了稳健且适应性强的决策支持工具，弥合了理论度量与实际应用需求之间的差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave)
network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting
surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple
users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the
users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer
problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To
cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage
the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two
sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then,
we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts
are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to
a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the
convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational
complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed
algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite
programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a
larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one
approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also
considered as other benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid decoding architecture that serially couples a
normalized min-sum (NMS) decoder with reinforced ordered statistics decoding
(OSD) to achieve near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance for short linear
block codes. The framework incorporates several key innovations: a decoding
information aggregation model that employs a convolutional neural network to
refine bit reliability estimates for OSD using the soft-output trajectory of
the NMS decoder; an adaptive decoding path for OSD, initialized by the arranged
list of the most a priori likely tests algorithm and dynamically updated with
empirical data; and a sliding window assisted model that enables early
termination of test error patterns' traversal, curbing complexity with minimal
performance loss. For short high-rate codes, a dedicated undetected error
detector identifies erroneous NMS outcomes that satisfy parity checks, ensuring
they are forwarded to OSD for correction. Extensive simulations on LDPC, BCH,
and RS codes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid decoder delivers a
competitive trade-off, achieving near-ML frame error rate performance while
maintaining advantages in throughput, latency, and complexity over
state-of-the-art alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波频谱存在严重信道衰落，需要优化RIS反射元件的相位偏移来增强可达速率。传统优化算法依赖完整准确的CSI，但RIS多为无源元件，难以获取CSI。

Method: 利用无监督学习技术，基于接收的导频信号提供隐式CSI。Capacity-Net建立接收导频信号、优化RIS相位偏移和可达速率之间的映射关系，避免传统信道估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于Capacity-Net的无监督学习方法优于基于传统信道估计的学习方法。

Conclusion: Capacity-Net通过无监督学习有效解决了RIS辅助毫米波MIMO系统中CSI获取困难的问题，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

Result: 在毫米波信道环境下，无论用户数量固定还是随机变化，所提DDPG方法均显著优于基于优化的算法和双深度Q学习，特别是在随机用户分布场景中表现更优。

Conclusion: DDPG框架能有效处理RIS反射特性中的耦合效应，在复杂多用户场景下实现更高的频谱效率，为实际RIS系统设计提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种协调FMCW-OFDM系统，通过让感知和通信共享相同的射频前端、天线和频谱资源，实现集成感知与通信。该系统将FMCW信号叠加在OFDM信号上，用于双基地感知和信道估计。

Method: 提出Co-FMCW-OFDM波形，开发了FCCR和DMD两种高效感知算法，利用感知结果辅助信道估计，并采用连续干扰消除技术来重构信道和消除FMCW信号干扰。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统的嵌入式导频OFDM系统相比，所提系统在感知精度、信道估计性能和误码率方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Co-FMCW-OFDM系统成功实现了集成感知与通信，通过波形设计和算法优化，在降低系统复杂度的同时提高了整体性能。

Abstract: We propose a coordinated FMCW-OFDM (Co-FMCW-OFDM) system that enables
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by allowing sensing and
communication to share the same RF front end, antennas, and spectral resources.
In the proposed ISAC system, the FMCW signal is superimposed on the OFDM signal
and serves dual purposes: facilitating bistatic sensing and enabling channel
estimation at the receiver end. Based on proposed Co-FMCW-OFDM waveform, we
propose two efficient sensing algorithms-fast cyclic correlation radar (FCCR)
and digital mixing and down-sampling (DMD)- which significantly reduce system
complexity while accurately estimating target range and velocity. We consider a
realistic channel model where delays can take any value, not just integer
multiples of the sampling period. This leads to a significantly larger number
of effective paths compared to the actual number of targets, which makes the
sensing, channel estimation, and interference cancellation more challenging.
Leveraging the sensing results, we develop a sensing-aided effective channel
estimation method which effectively reconstructs the channel under arbitrary
delay condition based on successive interference cancellation and propose an
interference cancellation scheme that removes the FMCW signal before the OFDM
demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
superior sensing accuracy, improved channel estimation, and lower bit error
rate (BER) compared to conventional OFDM systems with embedded pilots. The
proposed scheme demonstrates superior BER performance in comparison to the
conventional OFDM-plus-FMCW approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于集成感知与通信(ISAC)的快速算法OTFS雷达(FAOR)，能够以低复杂度进行雷达感知，同时支持双功能导频设计用于信道估计，在雷达感知和信道估计方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Recent studies shows that the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform
is a promising candidate for future communication. To meet users' potential
demand for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications in 6G, the
usage of OTFS for both radar sensing and wireless communication needs to be
explored. In this paper, we propose a Fast Algorithm OTFS radar (FAOR) that can
perform radar sensing in low complexity to detect the range and speed of the
targets. It computes the 2D cyclic correlation of transmitted signal with the
reordered delay Doppler (DD) domain received signals, and then generates the 2D
range-Doppler map. It can be applied not only to monostatic radar but also to
bistatic radar with a much lower computational complexity compared to
state-of-the-art radar sensing technology. With the detected time delays and
Doppler frequencies of the targets after the radar sensing, we propose a
pilot-aided channel estimation method. The multifunction pilot symbol can serve
the purpose of both bistatic radar sensing and channel estimation without any
guard symbol added, while reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
considerably compared to the conventional pilot design. The simulation results
show that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared algorithms and gives
decent performance in both radar sensing and channel estimation.

TL;DR: 提出Φ-Δ算法，一种确定性的自适应多阶段假设消除算法，用于以最少样本识别真实假设，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主动决策者在已知各假设下分布的情况下，使用尽可能少的样本识别真实假设的问题。

Method: 基于最大最小总变差距离选择行动，将相近分布聚类，通过多阶段假设消除过程逐步排除假设。

Result: 算法在期望错误概率趋近于零时是渐近最优的，在某些情况下在假设数量上也是渐近最优的。

Conclusion: Φ-Δ算法在样本效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，是解决假设检验问题的有效方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem where an active Decision-Maker (DM) is tasked to
identify the true hypothesis using as few samples as possible while maintaining
accuracy. The DM collects samples according to its determined actions and knows
the distributions under each hypothesis. We propose the $\Phi$-$\Delta$
algorithm, a deterministic and adaptive multi-stage hypothesis-elimination
algorithm where the DM selects an action, applies it repeatedly, and discards
hypotheses in light of its obtained samples. The DM selects actions based on
maximal separation expressed by the maximal minimal Total Variation Distance
(TVD) between each two possible output distributions. To further optimize the
search (in terms of the mean number of samples required to separate
hypotheses), close distributions (in TVD) are clustered, and the algorithm
eliminates whole clusters rather than individual hypotheses.
  We extensively analyze our algorithm and show it is asymptotically optimal as
the desired error probability approaches zero. Our analysis also includes
identifying instances when the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the
number of hypotheses, bounding the mean number of samples per-stage and in
total, characterizing necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing error
rates when clustering hypotheses, evaluating algorithm complexity, and
discussing its optimality in finite regimes.

TL;DR: 本文研究对抗插入-删除错误的线性纠错码，构建了接近半Singleton界的线性码，改进了之前的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大多数插入-删除错误模型下的构造是非线性的，但线性码具有紧凑表示、高效编码和解码算法的优势，因此研究线性码在这一模型下的性能具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了在有限域上的显式线性码：在F_{q^2}上线性于F_q的码，以及完全在F_q上的线性码，能够高效纠正一定比例的插入-删除错误。

Result: 构造的码率分别为1/2 - δ - ε和1/2 - 2√δ - ε，能够高效纠正δ比例的插入-删除错误，其中q = O(ε^{-4})。

Conclusion: 这些结果显著推进了插入-删除模型下线性码的研究，使其更接近理论上的半Singleton界，并推广了半Singleton界的适用范围。

Abstract: In this work, we study linear error-correcting codes against adversarial
insertion-deletion (indel) errors. While most constructions for the indel model
are nonlinear, linear codes offer compact representations, efficient encoding,
and decoding algorithms, making them highly desirable. A key challenge in this
area is achieving rates close to the half-Singleton bound for efficient linear
codes over finite fields. We improve upon previous results by constructing
explicit codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\), linear over \(\mathbb{F}_q\), with
rate \(1/2 - \delta - \varepsilon\) that can efficiently correct a
\(\delta\)-fraction of indel errors, where \(q = O(\varepsilon^{-4})\).
Additionally, we construct fully linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) with rate
\(1/2 - 2\sqrt{\delta} - \varepsilon\) that can also efficiently correct
\(\delta\)-fraction of indels. These results significantly advance the study of
linear codes for the indel model, bringing them closer to the theoretical
half-Singleton bound. We also generalize the half-Singleton bound, for every
code \(C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n\) linear over \(\mathbb{E} \subset \mathbb{F}\)
a subfield of $\mathbb{F}$, such that \(C\) has the ability to correct
\(\delta\)-fraction of indels, the rate is bounded by $(1-\delta)/2$.

Abstract: To increase the information capacity of DNA storage, composite DNA letters
were introduced. We propose a novel channel model for composite DNA in which
composite sequences are decomposed into ordered standard non-composite
sequences. The model is designed to handle any alphabet size and composite
resolution parameter. We study the problem of reconstructing composite
sequences of arbitrary resolution over the binary alphabet under substitution
errors. We define two families of error-correcting codes and provide lower and
upper bounds on their cardinality. In addition, we analyze the case in which a
single deletion error occurs in the channel and present a systematic code
construction for this setting. Finally, we briefly discuss the channel's
capacity, which remains an open problem.

Abstract: We study a joint communication and sensing setting comprising a transmitter,
a receiver, and a sensor, all equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter
sends an encoded signal over the channel with the dual purpose of communicating
an information message to the receiver, and enabling the sensor to estimate a
target parameter vector by generating back-scattered signals. We assume that
the transmitter and sensor are co-located, or fully connected, giving the
latter access to the transmitted signal. The target parameter vector is
randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, yet remains fixed throughout the
transmission block. We establish the fundamental performance trade-off between
the communication and sensing tasks, captured in terms of a capacity-MSE
function. In doing so, we identify optimal coding schemes for this
multi-antenna joint communication and sensing setting. Moreover, we
particularize our result to two practically-inspired scenarios where we
showcase optimal schemes and trade-offs.

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了图复制系统中PIR容量的理论理解，建立了不同PIR方案之间的联系，并为实际应用中的子分组化需求提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The problem of PIR in graph-based replication systems has received
significant attention in recent years. A systematic study was conducted by
Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the
storage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates
achievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the
ratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper
makes the following key contributions.
  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study
of PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for
$\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We
shrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,
  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\le 2/(N+1)$ and
conjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing
the strictly stronger bound $\mathcal{C}(K_N) \le \frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also
improve the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph
$\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$
was $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide
explicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving
$\mathcal{C}(K_N)\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\mathcal{C}(G)
\ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.
  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic
PIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for
reducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of
independent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that
performs particularly well on sparse graphs.
