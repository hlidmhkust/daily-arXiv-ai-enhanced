Interestingly, movable signals can dynamically adjust the operating frequency to orthogonalize the user channels, thereby significantly expanding the capacity regions. We also study frequency optimization, constraining it in a limited frequency range, and show that movable signals provide up to 45% sum rate gain over fixed signals."}

We introduce diversity evolution (DivE), a Boolean-function-based analysis method that tracks how the fading dependence of belief-propagation messages evolves across decoding iterations. Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings."}

This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance. Our proposed decoding and analysis are validated numerically."}

A rigorous system framework incorporating realistic 3GPP Tapped Delay Line (TDL) channel models is established to accurately capture high-mobility propagation characteristics. To counteract channel aging effects while maintaining low computational complexity, an SNR-aware flexible FTN strategy is introduced, wherein a low-complexity Look-Up Table (LUT) is utilized to adaptively optimize the time-domain compression factor based on instantaneous channel responses. Through this mechanism, the trade-off between rate acceleration and interference penalty is effectively resolved, ensuring that spectral efficiency is maximized while strict reliability constraints are satisfied with minimal processing overhead. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided, in which analytical expressions for effective throughput, energy efficiency, and bit error rate are derived.

Polar-domain near-field codebooks can focus energy accurately but incur extra two-dimensional sweeping overhead; compressed-sensing (CS) approaches with Gaussian-masked DFT sensing offer a lower-overhead alternative. This letter revisits near-field beam training using conventional DFT codebooks. Unlike far-field responses that concentrate energy on a few isolated DFT beams, near-field responses produce contiguous, plateau-like energy segments with sharp transitions in the DFT beamspace. Pure LASSO denoising, therefore, tends to over-shrink magnitudes and fragment plateaus. We propose a beam-pattern-preserving beam training scheme for multiple-path scenarios that combines LASSO with a lightweight denoising pipeline: LASSO to suppress small-amplitude noise, followed by total variation (TV) to maintain plateau levels and edge sharpness. The two proximal steps require no near-field codebook design. Simulations with Gaussian pilots show consistent NMSE and cosine-similarity gains over least squares and LASSO at the same pilot budget."}

Our approach hinges on the insight that by superimposing incoming signals with a strong local oscillator (LO), the complex atomic absorption pattern is linearized into a simple superposition of sinusoids. In this new representation, each spatial frequency uniquely and directly maps to the DoA of a target. This reduces the multi-target challenge into a spectral estimation problem, which we address using Prony's method. Our approach, termed Imaging-based Spectral Estimation (ISE), inherently supports multi-target detection and restores the full broadband capability of the sensor by removing the restrictive cell-length dependency.

We consider an ISAC-enabled base station that can sense the state of a remote source and communicate this information back to the source. Both sensing and communication succeed with given probabilities and incur distinct costs. The objective is to optimise a long-term cost that captures information freshness, measured by the age of information (AoI), at the source together with sensing and communication overheads. The resulting sequential decision problem is formulated as a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process with a two-dimensional AoI state, representing information freshness at the source and at the base station. We prove that the optimal stationary policy admits a monotone threshold structure characterised by a nondecreasing switching curve in the AoI state space. Our numerical analysis illustrates the structures of the value function and the optimal decision map. These results demonstrate that freshness-based objectives can be naturally integrated into ISAC design, while yielding interpretable and implementable strategies."}

The architecture incorporates a microcontroller connected to a single-antenna receiver operating at the same frequency as the RIS unit elements, operating either in transmission or reflection mode. The transmitting RIS elements enable the low latency estimation of both the incoming and outcoming channels at the microcontroller's side. In addition, a machine learning approach for estimating the incoming and outcoming channels involving the remaining RIS elements operating in reflection mode is devised. Specifically, by appropriately selecting a small number of elements in transmission mode, and based on the channel reciprocity principle, the respective channel coefficients are first estimated, which are then fed to a low-complexity neural network that, leveraging spatial channel correlation over RIS elements, returns predictions of the channel coefficients referring to the rest of elements. In this way, the SORIS microcontroller acquires channel state information, and accordingly reconfigures the panel's metamaterials to assist data communication between a transmitter and a receiver, without the need for separate connections with them. Moreover, the impact of channel estimation on the proposed solution, and a detailed complexity analysis for the used model, as well as a wiring density and control signaling analysis, is performed.

However, despite their significance and the emergence of various useful definitions, a complete characterization of measures of conditional entropy that satisfy a natural set of operational axioms has remained elusive.

Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images. Under limited annotation conditions, the framework achieves an overall detection accuracy of 67.8% mAP, validating its practicality and feasibility for intelligent agricultural applications."}

Capturing this interplay within a single physical-layer framework is particularly challenging in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the same waveform simultaneously serves dual purposes. We study a secure ISAC system in which a monostatic transmitter simultaneously sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver and senses an environmental state, while a passive adversary attempts both message decoding and state estimation. We partially characterize the fundamental trade-offs among three performance measures: the transmitter's secrecy rate, its detection exponent, and the adversary's detection exponent. Beyond the joint input distribution that governs overall performance, the trade-offs are further shaped by the transmitter's ability to extract keys via feedback and hide both the content and structure of the codewords via wiretap and resolvability codes. We derive an achievable region, and illustrate the resulting design trade-offs through a numerical example."}

Akan"], "title": "Intrinsic MIMO Particle Communication Channel with Random Advection", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "In this work, receiver diversity in advection-dominated diffusion-advection channels is investigated. Strong directed flow fundamentally alters the communication-theoretic properties of molecular communication systems (MC). Specifically, advection preserves the temporal ordering and shape of transmitted pulses, enabling pulse-based and higher-order modulation schemes that are typically infeasible in purely diffusive environments. Focusing on a single transmitter and a single type of information molecule, it is demonstrated that spatially distributed receivers can observe distinct realizations of the same transmitted signal, giving rise to diversity gain. Several receiver combining strategies are evaluated and shown to improve detection performance compared to single-receiver operation, particularly in low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The results provide a structured framework for understanding receiver-side diversity in molecular communication, highlighting the role of advection as a key enabler for reliable pulse-based signaling. This perspective establishes a foundation for future studies on advanced modulation, joint equalization and detection, and multi-molecule MIMO extensions that can further enhance the performance and physical applicability of MC systems."}

While considerable progress has been made in this field, most existing methods are supervised and require ground truth data for training-data that is often unavailable in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised training framework for HS-SISR, based on synthetic abundance data. The approach begins by unmixing the hyperspectral image into endmembers and abundances. A neural network is then trained to perform abundance super-resolution using synthetic abundances only. These synthetic abundance maps are generated from a dead leaves model whose characteristics are inherited from the low-resolution image to be super-resolved. This trained network is subsequently used to enhance the spatial resolution of the original image's abundances, and the final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by combining them with the endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate both the training value of the synthetic data and the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

By dynamically repositioning a liquid-based radiating element within a confined physical structure, FAS can exploit spatial diversity without relying on multiple fixed antenna elements. This spatial mobility provides a new degree of freedom for mitigating channel fading and interference, while maintaining low hardware complexity and power consumption. However, the performance of FAS in realistic deployments is strongly affected by channel uncertainty, hardware nonidealities, and mechanical constraints, all of which can substantially deviate from idealized analytical assumptions. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the operation and design of FAS under such practical considerations. Key aspects include the characterization of spatio-temporal channel uncertainty, analysis of hardware and mechanical impairments such as RF nonlinearity, port coupling, and fluid response delay, as well as the exploration of robust design and learning-based control strategies to enhance system reliability. Finally, open research directions are identified, aiming to guide future developments toward robust, adaptive, and cross-domain FAS design for next-generation wireless networks."}

We propose an unsupervised Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) framework that integrates empirical correction with physics-guided modeling for robust underwater image enhancement. DIVER first applies either IlluminateNet for adaptive luminance enhancement or a Spectral Equalization Filter for spectral normalization. An Adaptive Optical Correction Module then refines hue and contrast using channel-adaptive filtering, while Hydro-OpticNet employs physics-constrained learning to compensate for backscatter and wavelength-dependent attenuation. The parameters of IlluminateNet and Hydro-OpticNet are optimized via unsupervised learning using a composite loss function. DIVER is evaluated on eight diverse datasets covering shallow, deep, and highly turbid environments, including both naturally low-light and artificially illuminated scenes, using reference and non-reference metrics. While state-of-the-art methods such as WaterNet, UDNet, and Phaseformer perform reasonably in shallow water, their performance degrades in deep, unevenly illuminated, or artificially lit conditions. In contrast, DIVER consistently achieves best or near-best performance across all datasets, demonstrating strong domain-invariant capability. DIVER yields at least a 9% improvement over SOTA methods in UCIQE. On the low-light SeaThru dataset, where color-palette references enable direct evaluation of color restoration, DIVER achieves at least a 4.9% reduction in GPMAE compared to existing methods. Beyond visual quality, DIVER also improves robotic perception by enhancing ORB-based keypoint repeatability and matching performance, confirming its robustness across diverse underwater environments."}

While conventional linear receivers can suppress spectrally separated interferers under ideal hardware assumptions, receiver saturation and finite-resolution quantization cause nonlinear spectral leakage that severely degrades performance in practical wideband radios. We study the recovery of a desired signal from nonlinear receiver observations corrupted by a high-power out-of-band interferer. The receiver front-end is modeled as a smooth, memoryless nonlinearity followed by additive noise and optional quantization. To mitigate these nonlinear and quantization-induced distortions, we propose a learned multi-layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (LMLVAMP) algorithm that incorporates spectral priors with neural network based denoising. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional methods, particularly in high-interference regimes representative of FR3 coexistence scenarios."}

Together, these components enhance the network's ability to distinguish true structure from wrapping artifacts, yielding state-of-the-art performance across perceptual and linear HDR quality metrics."}

In large-scale simulations with complex environments, ray tracing at high resolution can be computationally demanding. To reduce the computation, this paper presents a novel method for conducting ray tracing at a coarse set of reference points and interpolating the channels at other locations. The key insight is to interpolate the images of reflected points. In addition to the computational savings, the method directly captures the spherical nature of each wavefront enabling fast and accurate computation of channels using line-of-sight MIMO and other wide aperture techniques. Through empirical validation and comparison with exhaustive ray tracing, we demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of our approach in achieving high-fidelity channel predictions with reduced computational resources."}

While standard pipelines treat these tasks in isolation, our core insight is that they are fundamentally synergistic: restoration provides clean anatomical structures to improve segmentation, while semantic priors regularize the restoration process. VL-DUN resolves the sub-optimality of sequential processing through two primary innovations. (1) We formulate AiOMIRS as a unified optimization problem, deriving an interpretable joint unfolding mechanism where restoration and segmentation are mathematically coupled for mutual refinement. (2) We introduce a frequency-aware Mamba mechanism to capture long-range dependencies for global segmentation while preserving the high-frequency textures necessary for restoration. This allows for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity, effectively mitigating the spectral bias of standard architectures. As a pioneering work in the AiOMIRS task, VL-DUN establishes a new state-of-the-art across multi-modal benchmarks, improving PSNR by 0.92 dB and the Dice coefficient by 9.76\\%. Our results demonstrate that joint collaborative learning offers a superior, more robust solution for complex clinical workflows compared to isolated task processing.

We then develop an algorithm to perform super-resolution that utilizes these priors to progressively refine reconstructions across different scales.
