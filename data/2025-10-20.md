### [1] [A Structured Family of Grassmannian Constellations via Geodesic Mapping for MIMO Noncoherent Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070)
*Álvaro Pendás-Recondo,Enrique Pendás-Recondo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmann流形测地线的新型MIMO非相干通信星座设计，具有单天线激活特性，降低了硬件复杂度和功耗，在有限星座规模下达到与优化设计相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MIMO非相干通信中缺乏信道状态信息的问题，设计一种既利用Grassmann流形几何结构又具有低硬件复杂度的星座方案。

Method: 基于Grassmann流形的测地线构建星座设计，确保每个时隙只有一个发射天线激活，从而简化硬件实现。

Result: 在0.25-1 bps/Hz速率范围内，该设计达到与最优化非结构化设计相当的误码性能，同时将ML检测器计算复杂度降低M倍。

Conclusion: 该Grassmann星座设计在性能与复杂度之间实现了良好平衡，特别适合硬件受限的MIMO非相干通信系统。

Abstract: This work presents a novel structured family of Grassmannian constellations
for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) noncoherent communications over
Rayleigh block-fading channels, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver
has channel state information (CSI). The proposed constellation design is built
upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its
underlying geometric structure. The resulting solution is limited in spectral
efficiency (with a maximum constellation size of $4M^2$ points, where $M$ is
the number of transmit antennas), targeting a rate in the range of $0.25$-$1$
bps/Hz. However, all space-time matrices resulting from this design exhibit the
remarkable property of having a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that only
one transmit antenna is active per time slot. This property significantly
reduces hardware complexity and implementation cost, while also lowering power
consumption, as only a single power amplifier is required for transmission.
Furthermore, within the constellation size limits, the proposed design achieves
error performance comparable to state-of-the-art optimization-based
unstructured designs, as validated through symbol error rate (SER) numerical
results. It also enables simple yet effective bit labeling, confirmed by
comparisons of bit error rate (BER) and SER, and reduces the computational
complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for Grassmannian
constellations by a factor of $M$.

### [2] [Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing & Communication with Zak-OTFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195)
*Nishant Mehrotra,Sandesh Rao Mattu,Robert Calderbank*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的最优脉冲成形滤波器，该滤波器同时满足定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个目标，在Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信框架中实现了改进的数据检测和输入输出关系估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信框架中，脉冲成形滤波器的设计至关重要。现有滤波器设计（如sinc、高斯、RRC等）只能同时满足三个关键目标中的两个：定位性（用于感知）、正交性（用于通信）和带宽/时间限制（用于频谱效率），无法同时满足所有三个目标。

Method: 采用各向同性正交变换算法（Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm）来设计最优脉冲成形滤波器，确保滤波器同时具备定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制特性。

Result: 提出的脉冲成形滤波器在数据检测（通信）和输入输出关系估计（感知）方面相比文献中现有的滤波器选择表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过各向同性正交变换算法设计的脉冲成形滤波器成功解决了Zak-OTFS集成感知与通信框架中滤波器设计的核心挑战，实现了定位性、正交性和带宽/时间限制三个关键目标的同步满足。

Abstract: Zak-OTFS is an emerging framework for integrated sensing & communication
(ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. A critical enabler for
ISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a
localized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation
estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication,
orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents
inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full
spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is
ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives,
but not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal
and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is
localized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is
localized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed
hybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and
bandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal
pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal
Transform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data
detection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance
compared to existing filter choices in the literature.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多维生理特征的MIMO生物雷达生命体征增强检测方法，通过两阶段融合策略解决传统阵列雷达多通道信号融合效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人口老龄化加剧和慢性疾病负担增加，生命体征监测需求日益迫切。当前毫米波雷达非接触检测技术面临基于等权重阵列雷达系统多通道信号融合效率低的关键挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段融合策略：第一阶段基于生理特征的单通道信号增强检测，构建胸壁多散射点模型，选择有效距离段并使用相位对齐最大比合并增强信噪比；第二阶段基于器官辐射空间分布特征的多通道融合，首次引入心肺器官空间辐射特征作为理论基础，进行通道筛选和加权融合。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生理特征驱动的两阶段融合策略，有效提升了MIMO生物雷达的生命体征检测性能，为生命体征监测提供了新的技术方案。

Abstract: With the intensiffcation of population aging and increasing burden of chronic
diseases, the demand for vital signs monitoring is becoming increasingly
urgent. A key challenge facing current non-contact detection technologies using
millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is the low efffciency of multi-channel signal
fusion in array radar systems based on equal weighting. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a vital sign enhancement detection method for
multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) bio-radar, driven by multidimensional
physiological characteristics, which overcomes traditional limitations through
a two-stage fusion strategy. Stage 1: Enhanced Vital Sign Detection Using
Single-Channel Signals Based on Physiological Characteristics. First, a chest
wall multi-scattering point model is constructed. For single channel
time-distance two-dimensional echo signals, effective range bins are selected
based on the respiratory/cardiac physiological frequency band energy ratio, and
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of respiration/heart signals is enhanced using
phase-aligned maximal ratio combining (MRC). Stage 2: Multi-Channel Fusion
Based on Organ Radiation Spatial Distribution Characteristics. The spatial
radiation characteristics of cardiopulmonary organs are introduced for the
ffrst time as the theoretical foundation for SNR-based channel screening,
channel attribute identiffcation, and multi-channel weighted fusion. Then, we
propose a template matching method to extract respiratory rate (RR) and heart
rate (HR) by adopting physical models of respiration and cardiac activities.
The experimental results demonstrate the existence of the spatial distribution
characteristics of organ radiation. In addition, we analyzed the impact of
distance and state on the algorithm from these two aspects.

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the functionalities, algorithms, hardware
components, and performance characteristics of future integrated sensing and
communication (ISAC) base stations (BSs) under realistic deployment scenarios
in controlled laboratory environments represents a critical requirement for
ISAC technology advancement. A primary challenge in achieving this objective
involves the emulation of multiple targets with arbitrary radar cross-section
(RCS), range, angle, and Doppler profiles for ISAC BS equipped with large-scale
antenna arrays using radar target simulator (RTS) with limited interface ports.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet highly effective and practical
conductive amplitude and phase matrix framework to address this fundamental
challenge. The core concept involves introducing a tunable conductive amplitude
and phase modulation network in the test configuration between the ISAC BS
under test and a RTS. Based on this structure, we subsequently investigate the
corresponding configurations for different sensing operational modes of ISAC
BSs, specifically the array duplex transmission and reception (ADTR) mode and
the split-array transmission and reception (SATR) mode. For experimental
validation, we design two distinct monostatic sensing scenarios to demonstrate
the framework capabilities across both operational modes. The first scenario
involves dynamic multi-drone sensing validation for ADTR mode operation, while
the second scenario addresses static single-drone sensing for SATR mode
validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework
can accurately emulate the joint RCS, range, velocity, and angular
characteristics of multiple sensing targets within the conductive test
environment, highlighting its significant potential for testing applications in
sub-6 GHz ISAC BS development and validation.

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) can achieve the sharing of
hardware and spectrum resources, enabling efficient data transmission and
environmental sensing. This fusion is particularly important for unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, as it enhances the overall performance,
flexibility, and efficiency of such systems. To facilitate the collaborative
operations among UAVs, this paper proposes an ISAC solution based on the
pseudo-random time-division multiplexing (TDM)-multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW).
Specifically, a novel ISAC chirp waveform is proposed to modulate data in both
the delay domain and complex amplitude, while also possessing high-precision
sensing capabilities. To address challenges in the TDM-MIMO, we utilize the
pseudo-random antenna selection and compressed sensing algorithms, ensuring
that the maximum unambiguous velocity is not compromised. Moreover, by
employing a chirp-division multiple access scheme, we propose an
interference-free multiple antenna transmission scheme to achieve dynamic
allocation of time-frequency resources and multi-user transmission. Finally, we
propose a communication and sensing fusion-based dynamic iterative computation
scheme, simultaneously achieving data demodulation and sensing parameter
estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve ISAC
under the dynamic flight scenarios of UAVs. Meanwhile, the scheme outperforms
the mmWave-LoRadar in communication and sensing performance, yet its sensing
performance is slightly lower than that of the traditional FMCW. Under the
urban clutter modeling, the scheme still maintains favorable robustness despite
a certain degree of performance degradation.

positive infinity.

### [7] [Resilient Full-Duplex ISAC in the Face of Imperfect SI Cancellation: Globally Optimal Timeslot Allocation and Beam Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15810)
*Luis F. Abanto-Leon,Setareh Maghsudi*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全双工ISAC系统中，需要协调感知和通信任务，同时处理残余自干扰问题，传统的资源管理方法难以有效应对这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一种定制化的重构策略，将半无限非凸混合整数非线性规划问题转化为可处理的混合整数线性规划问题，从而获得全局最优解。

Result: 该方法能够有效优化时隙分配和波束选择，提高了全双工ISAC系统的效率，并确保了对残余自干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过协调优化时隙分配和波束选择，可以显著提升全双工ISAC系统的性能，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink
full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly
optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect
self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of
discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam
selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive
beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer
nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we
develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a
tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal
solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of
timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex
ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.

Main category: eess.SP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Epileptic biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying the origin of
seizures, an essential aspect of pre-surgical planning for epilepsy treatment.
These biomarkers can vary significantly over time. By studying these temporal
fluctuations, we can enhance their effectiveness in guiding surgical planning.
This research focuses on examining how circadian rhythms influence epilepsy
biomarkers and aims to determine the optimal times for their analysis. To
investigate the relationship between epilepsy biomarkers and circadian rhythm,
the sleep/wake states first need to be classified. After the biomarkers are
identified, they are compared across these states. A retrospective analysis was
conducted on intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with focal
epilepsy. The biomarkers spike, sequence of spikes, high-frequency oscillations
(HFOs), and pathological HFOs were identified through automatic detection. The
alpha/delta ratio was also calculated to distinguish between asleep and awake
stages. Data from 9 patients were analyzed, and the classification of sleep and
wake states was achieved with an area under the curve of 84%. All biomarker
rates were higher during the sleep stage compared to the wake stage.
Pathological HFOs and the sequence of spikes proved to be more precise
indicators regarding distance to seizure onset than spikes or HFOs. Unlike
previous studies that relied predominantly on long-term spike biomarker
analysis, this study is the first to utilize a comprehensive set of biomarkers,
including HFOs, spike sequences, and pathological HFOs, to enhance seizure
onset zone prediction. The rates of epilepsy biomarkers during sleep vary
considerably from those seen while awake, making sleep data analysis more
effective for accurately predicting the seizure onset zone.

### [9] [On the Impact of Electromagnetic Interference and Inter-RIS Reflections in Indoor Factory Local 6G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15759)
*Ishan Rangajith Koralege,Nurul Huda Mahmood,Arthur Sousa de Sena,Italo Atzeni*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文分析了6G本地网络中多RIS系统的电磁干扰和RIS间反射问题，提出了基于黎曼共轭梯度法的优化算法来提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G本地网络需要满足更高性能要求，但实际部署中RIS会受到电磁干扰和RIS间反射的负面影响，特别是在多RIS多小区系统中，这些因素会显著降低系统性能。

Method: 首先通过系统级仿真评估EMI和IRR的影响，然后提出基于黎曼共轭梯度法的交替优化算法，考虑信道空间相关性来优化RIS相位偏移。

Result: 仿真显示EMI和IRR的联合影响比单独影响更严重，特别是在RIS尺寸和发射功率增加时。提出的优化算法在系统总速率和中断概率方面可带来数个数量级的增益。

Conclusion: 在多RIS系统中，EMI和IRR的联合影响不可忽视，提出的优化算法能有效缓解这些负面影响，显著提升6G本地网络的性能。

Abstract: The Sixth Generation (6G) radio technology is expected to include local 6G
networks as a special use case, extending the capabilities of `generic' 6G
networks towards more demanding performance requirements. Reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a novel paradigm for next-generation wireless
communications, especially in the context of local 6G networks, enabling
advanced signal propagation control through intelligent phase-shift
configurations. However, in practical deployments, their performance can be
adversely affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources
and inter-RIS reflections (IRR) caused by signal reflections between multiple
colocated RIS units. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the joint
impact of EMI and IRR in a multi-RIS multi-cell system deployed within an
indoor factory environment. A detailed evaluation study is first carried out to
investigate their impact on system performance. System-level simulations
demonstrate that the joint impact of EMI and IRR degrades system performance
more significantly than their individual effects, particularly as RIS
dimensions and transmit power increase. To address these adverse effects, an
alternate optimization algorithm using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method
is then proposed. The novel algorithm optimizes the phase shifts of the RIS
elements considering the spatial correlation among their associated channels,
and is found to provide up to several orders of magnitude gains in terms of the
system sum rate and the outage probability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIMO接收机面临相位模糊和复杂度高的问题，需要一种能够有效对齐信号相位并降低复杂度的解决方案。

Method: 引入RIS辅助架构，采用PAM调制对齐信号与本地振荡器相位，将非凸优化问题重构为Frobenius范数最小化问题，并使用Adam梯度下降算法求解。

Result: 该方法有效缓解了相位模糊问题，显著降低了信号检测复杂度和整体接收机复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的RIS辅助原子MIMO接收机架构提供了一种低复杂度且有效的解决方案，能够改善MIMO系统的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and low-complexity atomic multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) receiver architecture assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS). By introducing RIS and utilizing pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM), the phase of the transmitted signal is effectively aligned
with that of the local oscillator (LO), thereby mitigating phase ambiguity and
substantially reducing both signal detection complexity and overall receiver
complexity.To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we
reformulate it into a tractable form by minimizing the Frobenius norm of an
equivalent matrix, which is efficiently solved using an Adam-based gradient
descent algorithm.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于里德堡原子量子(RAQ)的MIMO卫星在直接地对空上行链路中的性能优势，分析了RAQ-MIMO相比传统RF-MIMO在信道估计和数据速率方面的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用里德堡原子量子技术提升卫星通信性能，特别是在长距离传输和严格功率约束场景下，为下一代卫星网络提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过推导信道估计的均方误差和归一化均方误差的闭式表达式，分析MRC和ZF检测方案的可实现数据速率下界，并进行蒙特卡洛仿真验证。

Result: RAQ-MIMO在瑞利衰落信道下实现"平方"增益，在LoS主导的卫星信道中增益趋于饱和，主要来自归一化噪声背景的改善。RAQ-MIMO可减小天线孔径、降低发射功率并延长通信距离。

Conclusion: RAQ-MIMO卫星在性能上优于传统RF-MIMO，特别是在长距离传输场景中，为下一代卫星网络的发展提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance advantages of Rydberg atomic quantum
(RAQ)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellites for enhancing
direct ground-to-space uplink access.We analytically evaluate the impact of
Rydberg atoms on channel estimation by deriving closed-form expressions for the
mean-square error (MSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE). Based on the
estimated channels, we further derive lower bounds on the achievable data rates
for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detection schemes.
Rigorous analysis demonstrates that RAQ-MIMO outperforms conventional
radio-frequency (RF) MIMO under both Rayleigh and satellite channel conditions.
Specifically, compared with conventional MIMO, RAQR achieves a ``squaring" gain
under Rayleigh fading, especially in long-distance transmission scenarios with
stringent power constraints. In contrast, under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated
satellite channels, this gain saturates as channel-estimation benefits
diminish, with the remaining improvement primarily arising from the normalized
noise background. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and
show that the performance gains of RAQ-MIMO satellites translate into smaller
antenna apertures, lower transmit power, and longer communication ranges,
thereby paving the way for next-generation satellite networks.

Conclusion: 该混合架构使基站能够可靠检测仅靠收集能量供电的物联网设备的微弱上行信号，实现了无电池通信。

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a hybrid simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT)-enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
architecture, where the base station (BS) uses a conventional RF transmitter
for downlink transmission and a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQR) for
receiving uplink signal from Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To fully exploit
this integration, we jointly design the transmission scheme and the
power-splitting strategy to maximize the sum rate, which leads to a non-convex
problem. To address this challenge, we first derive closed-form lower bounds on
the uplink achievable rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing
(ZF), as well as on the downlink rate and harvested energy for maximum ratio
transmission (MRT) and ZF precoding. Building upon these bounds, we propose an
iterative algorithm relying on the best monomial approximation and geometric
programming (GP) to solve the non-convex problem. Finally, simulations validate
the tightness of our derived lower bounds and demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Importantly, by integrating RAQR
with SWIPT-enabled MIMO, the BS can reliably detect weak uplink signals from
IoT devices powered only by harvested energy, enabling battery-free
communication.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Base Representation (ABR) Theorem and
proposes a novel number system that offers a structured alternative to the
binary number system for digital computers. The ABR number system enables each
decimal number to be represented uniquely and using the same number of bits,
$n$, as the binary encoding. Theoretical foundations and mathematical
formulations demonstrate that ABR can encode the same integer range as binary,
validating its potential as a viable alternative. Additionally, the ABR number
system is compatible with existing data compression algorithms like Huffman
coding and arithmetic coding, as well as error detection and correction
mechanisms such as Hamming codes. We further explore practical applications,
including digital steganography, to illustrate the utility of ABR in
information theory and digital encoding, suggesting that the ABR number system
could inspire new approaches in digital data representation and computational
design.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了可移动天线(MAs)支持的多输入单输出(MISO)系统，在延迟敏感场景下，基站仅依靠统计信道状态信息传输数据，通过联合优化天线位置和发射波束成形来最大化用户的总中断感知速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在延迟敏感场景中，用户避免定期发送训练信号进行信道估计以避免额外延迟，因此基站只能依赖统计CSI传输数据。需要解决在固定传输速率下如何最大化系统性能的问题。

Method: 采用基于统计CSI的迫零波束成形设计，通过重要引理推导SINR的紧致均值和方差，利用Laguerre级数近似得到SINR的闭式紧致CDF，并开发投影梯度上升(PGA)方法迭代更新天线位置。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案相比传统固定位置天线(FPA)和其他竞争基准具有更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: 可移动天线系统在仅依赖统计CSI的场景下能够显著提升系统性能，提出的优化方法有效解决了天线位置和波束成形的联合优化问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the movable antennas (MAs)-enabled
multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems, where the base station (BS)
equipped with multiple MAs serves multiple single-antenna user. The
delay-sensitive scenario is considered, where users refrain from periodically
sending training signals to the BS for channel estimations to avoid additional
latency. As a result, the BS relies solely on the statistical channel state
information (CSI) to transmit data with a fixed rate. Under this setup, we aim
to maximize the outage-aware sum rate of all users, by jointly optimizing
antenna positions and the transmit beamforming at the BS, while satisfying the
given target outage probability requirement at each user. The problem is highly
non-convex, primarily because the exact cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user is
difficult to derive. To simplify analysis and without comprising performance,
we adopt the statistical CSI based zero-forcing beamforming design. We then
introduce one important lemma to derive the tight mean and variance of the
SINR. Leveraging these results, we further exploit the Laguerre series
approximation to successfully derive the closedform and tight CDF of the SINR.
Subsequently, the outageaware sum rate expression is presented but still
includes complex structure with respect to antenna positions. Facing this
challenge, the projected gradient ascent (PGA) method is developed to
iteratively update antenna positions until convergence. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes compared to conventional
fixed-position antenna (FPA) and other competitive benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于集成感知与通信(ISAC)的双层信道重构框架，通过在无人机上部署可旋转天线来主动控制感知与通信信道的路径损耗和相关性，实现两者性能的灵活权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于感知与通信共享无线资源，如何在两者之间实现关键权衡具有挑战性。需要一种能够主动控制信道特性的框架来优化ISAC系统的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过主动控制信道特性，有效解决了ISAC系统中感知与通信性能的权衡问题，为未来无线网络提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a key enabler for
future wireless networks by sharing the hardware and wireless resources between
the functionalities of sensing and communication (S&C). Due to the shared
wireless resources for both S&C, it is challenging to achieve a critical
trade-off between these two integrated functionalities. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a novel dual-level channel reconfiguration framework for
ISAC by deploying rotatable antennas at an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where
both the large-scale path loss and the correlation of S&C channels can be
proactively controlled, thereby allowing a flexible trade-off between S&C
performance. To characterize the S&C tradeoff, we aim to maximize the
communication rate by jointly optimizing the RA rotation, the transmit
beamforming, and the UAV trajectory, subject to the given requirement of
sensing performance. For the typical scenario of static UAV deployment, we
introduce the concept of subspace correlation coefficient to derive closed-form
solutions for the optimal RA rotation, transmit beamforming, and UAV hovering
location. For the scenario of a fully mobile UAV, we prove that the optimal
trajectory of a UAV follows a hover-fly-hover (HFH) structure, thereby
obtaining its global optimal solution. Simulation results show that the
proposed design significantly improves the achievable S&C trade-off region
compared to benchmark schemes.

Motivation: 可移动天线技术能够通过自适应调整天线位置来重新配置无线信道，为系统性能提升带来额外的空间自由度。从安全角度出发，利用MA技术来破坏可疑通信具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 可移动天线技术在干扰可疑通信方面具有显著优势，通过优化天线部署和波束成形可以有效降低可疑通信的性能。

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology which can reconfigure wireless
channels via adaptive antenna position adjustments at transceivers, thereby
bringing additional spatial degrees of freedom for improving system
performance. In this paper, from a security perspective, we exploit the
MAenabled legitimate jammer (MAJ) to subvert suspicious multiuser downlink
communications consisting of one suspicious transmitter (ST) and multiple
suspicious receivers (SRs). Specifically, our objective is to minimize the
benefit (the sum rate of all SRs or the minimum rate among all SRs) of such
suspicious communications, by jointly optimizing antenna positions and the
jamming beamforming at the MAJ. However, the key challenge lies in that given
the MAJ's actions, the ST can reactively adjust its power allocations to
instead maximize its benefit for mitigating the unfavorable interference. Such
flexible behavior of the ST confuses the optimization design of the MAJ to a
certain extent. Facing this difficulty, corresponding to the above two
different benefits: i) we respectively determine the optimal behavior of the ST
given the MAJ's actions; ii) armed with these, we arrive at two simplified
problems and then develop effective alternating optimization based algorithms
to iteratively solve them. In addition to these, we also focus on the special
case of two SRs, and reveal insightful conclusions about the deployment rule of
antenna positions at the MAJ. Furthermore, we analyze the ideal antenna
deployment scheme at the MAJ for achieving the globally performance lower
bound. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes
compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and other competitive
benchmarks.

### [17] [ProxySelect: Frequency Selectivity-Aware Scheduling for Joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO in 802.11ax WiFi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15452)
*Xiang Zhang,Michail Palaiologos,Christian Bluemm,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了ProxySelect算法，用于802.11ax中OFDMA和MU-MIMO联合使用的用户调度，通过代理速率和采样候选组生成来降低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着WiFi带宽增长，信道频率选择性增强，传统窄带用户选择算法在802.11ax中效率低下，需要解决频率选择性带来的用户选择挑战。

Method: 将调度任务建模为整数线性规划，引入代理速率近似ZFBF速率，开发基于采样的候选组生成方案限制ILP规模。

Result: 使用真实射线追踪信道模型的仿真显示，ProxySelect在显著降低复杂度的同时实现了接近最优的速率性能。

Conclusion: ProxySelect算法能够有效解决802.11ax中频率选择性带来的用户调度挑战，在保证性能的同时实现了可扩展性。

Abstract: IEEE 802.11ax introduces orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) to WiFi to support concurrent transmissions to a larger number of
users. As bandwidth continues to grow, WiFi channels exhibit increased
frequency selectivity, which poses new challenges for MU-MIMO user selection:
the optimal user set varies across frequency and is interleaved over subbands
(called resource units, or RUs). This frequency selectivity, coupled with the
complex subband allocation pattern, renders conventional narrowband user
selection algorithms inefficient for 802.11ax. In this paper, we propose
\emph{ProxySelect}, a scalable and frequency selectivity-aware user scheduling
algorithm for joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO usage in 802.11ax under zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF). The scheduling task is formulated as an integer linear
program (ILP) with binary variables indicating user (group)-RU associations,
and linear constraints ensuring standard compatibility. To reduce complexity,
we introduce a novel proxy rate--a function of individual channel strengths and
their correlations--that approximates the ZFBF rate without requiring
cubic-complexity matrix inversion. Additionally, we develop a sampling-based
candidate group generation scheme that selects up to $T$ near-orthogonal user
groups for each RU, thereby bounding the ILP size and ensuring scalability.
Simulations using realistic ray-tracing-based channel models show that
ProxySelect achieves near-optimal rate performance with significantly lower
complexity.

Motivation: 解决宽带无线通信网络下的近场成像问题，利用近场信道特性和频域图像相关性来提升成像质量。

Method: 将图像恢复建模为特殊MMV压缩感知问题，提出SBL方法同时估计多频图像系数及其相关性，并设计两种照明模式：最小化感知矩阵总相干性和最大化成像区域照明功率。

Result: 数值结果表明所提SBL方法和照明设计的有效性及优越性。

Conclusion: 基于SBL的方法结合优化的照明模式设计能够有效提升宽带近场成像性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the near-field imaging under a wideband wireless
communication network by exploiting both the near-field channel of a uniform
linear array (ULA) and the image correlation in the frequency domain. We first
formulate the image recovery as a special multiple measurement vector (MMV)
compressed sensing (CS) problem, where at various frequencies the sensing
matrices can be different, and the image coefficients are correlated. To solve
such an MMV problem with various sensing matrices and correlated coefficients,
we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based solution to simultaneously
estimate all image coefficients and their correlation on multiple frequencies.
Moreover, to enhance estimation performance, we design two illumination
patterns following two different criteria. From the CS perspective, the first
design minimizes the total coherence of the sensing matrix to increase the
mutual orthogonality of the basis vectors. Alternatively, to improve SNR, the
second design maximizes the illumination power of the imaging area. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBL-based method and the
superiority of the illumination designs.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了圆形复q阶正交对模糊集(CCq-ROFS)的概念，统一了现有的圆形复直觉模糊集和复q阶正交对模糊集框架，并基于高斯函数构建了新的聚合算子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模糊集框架存在局限性，需要一种能够统一不同模糊集类型并提供更平滑、统计意义更强的模糊表示方法。

Method: 扩展高斯框架到CCq-ROFS，使用高斯三角范数和余范数构建新的高斯聚合算子，包括高斯加权算术和高斯加权几何聚合算子。

Result: 成功构建了CCq-ROFS的统一框架，当q=2时为圆形复毕达哥拉斯模糊集，q=3时为圆形复费马模糊集，并开发了相应的聚合算子。

Conclusion: CCq-ROFS为模糊建模和决策提供了更强大和统一的数学工具，能够更有效地整合隶属度和非隶属度信息。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the circular complex $q$-rung
orthopair fuzzy set (CC$q$-ROFS) as a novel generalization that unifies the
existing frameworks of circular complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CCIFSs) and
complex $q$-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. If $q = 2$, the structure is referred to
as a circular complex Pythagorean fuzzy set, and if $q = 3$, it is called a
circular complex Fermatean fuzzy set. The proposed approach extends the
Gaussian-based framework to the CC$q$-ROFSs, aiming to achieve a smoother and
statistically meaningful representation of uncertainty. Within this setting,
new Gaussian-based aggregation operators for CC$q$-ROFSs are constructed by
employing the Gaussian triangular norm and conorm. Furthermore,
Gaussian-weighted arithmetic and Gaussian-weighted geometric aggregation
operators are formulated to enable consistent integration of membership and
non-membership information for fuzzy modeling and decision-making.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出学习型双层架构发现框架(LTTADF)，用于在考虑电路复杂度的约束下发现非理想BD-RIS的最优架构，解决非理想性和电路复杂度对性能的联合影响问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BD-RIS设计主要关注理想情况下的架构优化，但实际部署中非理想因素(如硬件缺陷)与电路复杂度共同影响性能，现有研究尚未探索非理想BD-RIS的架构发现问题。

Method: 提出LTTADF框架，包含架构生成器和性能优化器两个层级，能够在大规模架构空间中有效搜索，避免陷入局部最优，实现接近全局最优的性能优化。

Result: 数值结果表明该框架能够为部署非理想BD-RIS提供有价值的性能-电路复杂度权衡见解。

Conclusion: LTTADF框架成功解决了非理想BD-RIS架构发现的挑战，为下一代无线网络中BD-RIS的实际部署提供了有效的设计指导。

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been
introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further
increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and
improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks.
A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between
its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring
optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS,
architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore,
how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of
BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance -
circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially,
architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the
computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in
achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of
an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover
optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities,
which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding
getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions
for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights
for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity
tradeoff.

### [21] [Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347)
*Yuxiao Sun,Yao Zhao,Meiqin Liu,Chao Yao,Jian Jin,Weisi Lin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种对称熵约束视频编码框架SEC-VCM，通过建立视频编解码器与视觉骨干网络之间的对称对齐，在保持语义信息的同时丢弃机器视觉系统无关信息，在多任务场景下实现了SOTA的率-任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编码方法通常将编解码器与特定下游模型绑定，需要重新训练或监督数据，限制了在多任务场景下的泛化能力。虽然统一VCM框架使用视觉骨干网络支持多任务，但很少探索如何直接连接视频编码与理解。

Method: 提出对称熵约束视频编码框架SEC-VCM：1) 建立编解码器与视觉骨干网络的对称对齐；2) 双向熵约束机制通过抑制条件熵确保解码与编码过程的对称性；3) 语义-像素双路径融合模块将像素级先验注入最终重建。

Result: 在视频实例分割(37.41%)、视频对象分割(29.83%)、对象检测(46.22%)和多对象跟踪(44.94%)任务上，相比VTM实现了显著的比特率节省，达到了SOTA的率-任务性能。

Conclusion: SEC-VCM框架通过对称对齐和语义-像素融合，有效提升了机器视觉任务的视频编码效率，为多任务场景下的视频编码提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS)
instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has
become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to
specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus
limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM
frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models
(VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They
mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic
information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with
understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric
Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It
establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the
codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and
discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional
entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of
video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps
the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while
squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion
(SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through
semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves
machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our
framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with
significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%),
video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple
object tracking (44.94%). We will release our code.

Result: 在ISIC-2016和PH2数据集上，仅使用50%标注数据就实现了0.9153的Dice相似系数和0.8552的交并比，超越了基于重建和纯CNN的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强伪标签质量和边界描绘，在低标注情况下表现出优越性能，代码已在GitHub公开。

Abstract: Automated skin lesion segmentation through dermoscopic analysis is essential
for early skin cancer detection, yet remains challenging due to limited
annotated training data. We present MIRA-U, a semi-supervised framework that
combines uncertainty-aware teacher-student pseudo-labeling with a hybrid
CNN-Transformer architecture. Our approach employs a teacher network
pre-trained via masked image modeling to generate confidence-weighted soft
pseudo-labels, which guide a U-shaped CNN-Transformer student network featuring
cross-attention skip connections. This design enhances pseudo-label quality and
boundary delineation, surpassing reconstruction-based and CNN-only baselines,
particularly in low-annotation regimes. Extensive evaluation on ISIC-2016 and
PH2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice Similarity

only 50% labeled data. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了现有研究的空白，为学习型视频编码器的设计提供了系统性的指导

Abstract: Recent advances in learned video codecs have demonstrated remarkable
compression efficiency. Two fundamental design aspects are critical: the choice
of inter-frame coding framework and the temporal information propagation
strategy. Inter-frame coding frameworks include residual coding, conditional
coding, conditional residual coding, and masked conditional residual coding,
each with distinct mechanisms for utilizing temporal predictions. Temporal
propagation methods can be categorized as explicit, implicit, or hybrid
buffering, differing in how past decoded information is stored and used.
However, a comprehensive study covering all possible combinations is still
lacking. This work systematically evaluates the impact of explicit, implicit,
and hybrid buffering on coding performance across four inter-frame coding
frameworks under a unified experimental setup, providing a thorough
understanding of their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场图像的高维特性导致数据量巨大，现有神经表示方法缺乏对场景结构的显式建模，且通常没有端到端率失真优化，限制了压缩效率。

Method: 引入分层场景建模块，利用多尺度潜在码捕获内在场景结构；首次将熵约束量化感知训练融入神经表示压缩，实现端到端率失真优化。

Conclusion: SANR通过场景感知建模和端到端率失真优化，为光场图像压缩提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Light field images capture multi-view scene information and play a crucial
role in 3D scene reconstruction. However, their high-dimensional nature results
in enormous data volumes, posing a significant challenge for efficient
compression in practical storage and transmission scenarios. Although neural
representation-based methods have shown promise in light field image
compression, most approaches rely on direct coordinate-to-pixel mapping through
implicit neural representation (INR), often neglecting the explicit modeling of
scene structure. Moreover, they typically lack end-to-end rate-distortion
optimization, limiting their compression efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose SANR, a Scene-Aware Neural Representation framework for
light field image compression with end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. For
scene awareness, SANR introduces a hierarchical scene modeling block that
leverages multi-scale latent codes to capture intrinsic scene structures,
thereby reducing the information gap between INR input coordinates and the
target light field image. From a compression perspective, SANR is the first to
incorporate entropy-constrained quantization-aware training (QAT) into neural
representation-based light field image compression, enabling end-to-end
rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that
SANR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding
rate-distortion performance with a 65.62\% BD-rate saving against HEVC.
