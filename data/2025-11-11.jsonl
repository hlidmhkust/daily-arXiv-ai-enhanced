Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins."}

However, most ICM frameworks utilize learned image compression (LIC) models that operate at a fixed rate and require separate training for each target bitrate, which may limit their practical applications. Existing variable rate LIC approaches mitigate this limitation but typically depend on training, increasing computational cost and deployment complexity. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free, adaptive quantization step size control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By leveraging both channel-wise entropy dependencies and spatial scale parameters predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method preserves semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. The bitrate can be continuously controlled through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate method."}

We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights.

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems."}

Specifically, leveraging the low-rank and sparse characteristics of the mmWave channel matrix, a two-phase rank-aware compressed sensing framework is proposed for efficient channel estimation and reconstruction. In the first phase, a robust rank-one matrix completion (R1MC) algorithm is used to reconstruct part of the observed channel matrix through low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). To address abrupt rank changes caused by user mobility, a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model is established that leverages temporal rank correlations across consecutive time instances to enable adaptive observation matrix completion, thereby improving estimation accuracy under dynamic conditions. In the second phase, a rank-aware block orthogonal matching pursuit (RA-BOMP) algorithm is developed for sparse channel recovery with low computational complexity. Furthermore, a rank-aware measurement matrix design is introduced to improve angle estimation accuracy.

However, the procedure requires considerable scanning time, leading to patient discomfort and the potential for motion-induced artifacts. Reducing the number of projection views while keeping the time per view unchanged provides a mechanism to shorten the scanning time. However, this approach leads to increased sampling artifacts, higher noise, and hence limited image quality. To address these issues, we propose sparseview SPECT image enhancement (SPASHT), inherently training the algorithm to improve performance on defect-detection tasks. We objectively evaluated SPASHT on the clinical task of detecting perfusion defects in a retrospective clinical study using data from patients who underwent MPI SPECT, where the defects were clinically realistic and synthetically inserted. The study was conducted for different numbers of fewer projection views, including 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 of the typical projection views for MPI SPECT. Performance on the detection task was quantified using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Images obtained with SPASHT yielded significantly improved AUC compared to those obtained with the sparse-view protocol for all the considered numbers of fewer projection views. To further assess performance, a human observer study on the task of detecting perfusion defects was conducted. Results from the human observer study showed improved detection performance with images reconstructed using SPASHT compared to those from the sparse-view protocol. The results provide evidence of the efficacy of SPASHT in improving the quality of sparse-view MPI SPECT images and motivate further clinical validation."}

The conventional localization methods rely on complex infrastructure for providing cooperative anchor nodes that often contribute to higher network overload and energy consumption. To address this, the passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be leveraged as perfectly synced reference nodes for developing anchor-free localization. This work proposes a two-stage framework for localizing user equipment (UE) equipped with multiple antennas. At first, we show that the optimal RIS phase shift matrix maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RIS-assisted anchor-free localization is independent of UE location, making the proposed framework scalable without increasing the overhead to control RIS. The proposed two-stage framework first obtains a coarse estimate of UE's location by correlating the received RIS-reflected signal with a dictionary constructed using line-of-sight (LoS) components at a few reference positions. Next, the coarse estimate is refined using Newton's refinement. The numerical results show that the small-sized dictionary, constructed using fewer reference positions, can be employed for accurate localization with a slight increase in the required number of refinement iterations."}

Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme."}

Existing public datasets, such as CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts. There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using Olympus 170 and Pentax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate baseline performance, we provide benchmark results for classification using VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises 1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation. Performance was lower compared to curated datasets, reflecting the real-world difficulty of images with artifacts and variable quality."}

We propose four axioms and rigorously prove that the family of pairwise rank-Copulas is the minimal sufficient representation for minimal structural semantics. Based on this, we construct a semantic distortion metric, centered on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We then establish the core theoretical boundaries of the framework: sample complexity bounds; rate-distortion bounds; an end-to-end Service Level Agreements theorem; and a semantic source-channel separation theorem, which provides a provable Quality of Service guarantee. Finally, we validate our framework through decoupled experiments, empirically demonstrating that our core metric strictly adheres to our foundational axioms while standard perceptual metrics fail to do so."}

In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cramér-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance. Then, we propose a two-stage positioning method starting with a (i) MCRB-based weighted orbit calibration, followed by (ii) least-squares user positioning using the corrected orbit. The MCRB analysis indicates that orbital errors can induce kilometer-level position biases. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimator can considerably enhance the positioning accuracy relative to the orbit-mismatched baseline, yielding errors on the order of a few meters."}

In particular, we add organ segmentation masks from the TotalSegmentator tool as auxiliary inputs to provide anatomical context to nnDetection, which is the state-of-the-art for lesion detection, and Swin Transformer. The latter is trained in two stages that combine self-supervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. The method is tested in the AutoPET and Karolinska lymphoma datasets. The results indicate that the inclusion of anatomical priors substantially improves the detection performance within the nnDetection framework, while it has almost no impact on the performance of the vision transformer. Moreover, we observe that Swin Transformer does not offer clear advantages over conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders used in nnDetection. These findings highlight the critical role of the anatomical context in cancer lesion detection, especially in CNN-based models."}

Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-RIS can significantly improve covert performance, particularly in angular-overlap scenarios where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation. These findings further highlight the effectiveness of FD-RIS in enhancing CC robustness under challenging spatial environments."}

A detailed PSI-enabled reconstruction model is formulated using various forms of PSI. The hierarchical block orthogonal matching pursuit with PSI (HiBOMP-P) algorithm is designed in a recursive form to reliably recover hierarchically block-sparse signals. We derive exact recovery conditions (ERCs) measured by the mutual incoherence property (MIP), wherein hierarchical MIP concepts are proposed, and further develop reconstructible sparsity levels to reveal sufficient conditions for ERCs. Leveraging these MIP analyses, we present several extended insights, including reliable recovery conditions in noisy scenarios and the optimal hierarchical structure for cases where sparsity is not equal to zero. Our results further confirm that HCS offers improved recovery performance even when the prior information does not overlap with the true support set, whereas existing methods heavily rely on this overlap, thereby compromising performance if it is absent."}

In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions.

Clinically, BPE is qualitatively assessed by radiologists, but quantitative BPE measures offer potential for more precise risk evaluation. This study evaluated an existing open-source, fully-automated deep learning-based (DL-based) method for segmenting fibroglandular tissue (FGT) to quantify BPE and compared it to a semi-automated fuzzy c-means method. Using breast MRI examinations from 100 women, we evaluated segmentation agreement, concordance across quantitative BPE metrics, and associations with qualitative BPE. The quality of FGT segmentations from both methods was scored by a radiologist. While the DL-based and semi-automated methods showed good agreement for quantitative BPE measurements, DL-based measures more strongly correlated with qualitative BPE assessments and DL-based segmentations were scored as higher quality by the radiologist. Our findings suggest that DL-based FGT segmentation enhances efficiency for objective BPE quantification and may improve standardized breast cancer risk assessment."}

We propose a novel task-adaptive reconstruction framework that addresses this gap by incorporating a frozen pre-trained task network as a regularization term in the reconstruction loss function. Unlike existing joint-training approaches that simultaneously optimize both reconstruction and task networks, and risk diverging from satisfactory reconstructions, our method leverages a pre-trained task model to guide reconstruction training while still maintaining diagnostic quality. We validate our framework on a liver and liver tumor segmentation task. Our task-adaptive models achieve Dice scores up to 0.707, approaching the performance of full-dose scans (0.874), and substantially outperforming joint-training approaches (0.331) and traditional reconstruction methods (0.626).

A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

Although NR-VQA models attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective scores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of fine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these challenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the semantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video metadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted from inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in generating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been designed to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic alignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These multimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality scores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving improved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations.

Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead."}

The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels."}

Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse μ-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions."}

To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs."}

The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms."}

By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics.

In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learn- ing modules.

By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based procedure not only achieves superior spectral efficiency but also scales favorably with the number of antennas and UEs compared to state-of-the-art SCA-based algorithms, making it a practical tool for next-generation multicast systems."}

While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI. We then show that with a more nuanced approach it is possible to leverage total correlation to deliver an additional BLER improvement of around 0.75 dB while retaining reduced query numbers."}

Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme."}

In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems."}
