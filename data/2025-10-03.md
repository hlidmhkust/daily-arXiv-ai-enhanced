Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: JaneEye是一个专为可穿戴设备设计的基于事件相机的眼动追踪硬件加速器，采用轻量级神经网络架构，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: JaneEye为下一代XR可穿戴设备设定了低功耗、高性能眼动追踪解决方案的新基准。

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in
Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems
often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency,
and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering
ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we
present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware
accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse,
high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural
network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the
traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving
computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our
proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+
dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To
further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of
activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization.
Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at
400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames
Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a
new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable
for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

### [2] [Satellite Assignment Policy Learning for Coexistence in LEO Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01408)
*Jeong Min Kong,Ian P. Roberts*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图结构学习的算法，用于推断低地球轨道卫星系统中主系统的卫星分配策略，帮助次系统在不干扰主用户的情况下运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LEO卫星系统中，次系统需要避免对主用户造成过度干扰，但主系统的卫星分配策略未公开。因此需要开发方法来推断这些策略。

Method: 使用基于图结构学习的端到端算法，利用有限的历史数据学习主卫星分配策略，能够直接将主卫星坐标映射到主用户的分配决策。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法优于最佳基线，预测准确率提高了约15%。

Conclusion: 提出的图结构学习算法能有效推断主系统卫星分配策略，为次系统提供可靠的干扰避免机制。

Abstract: Unlike in terrestrial cellular networks, certain frequency bands for
low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems have thus far been allocated on a
non-exclusive basis. In this context, systems that launch their satellites
earlier (referred to as primary systems) are given spectrum access priority
over those that launch later, known as secondary systems. For a secondary
system to function, it is expected to either coordinate with primary systems or
ensure that it does not cause excessive interference to primary ground users.
Reliably meeting this interference constraint requires real-time knowledge of
the receive beams of primary users, which in turn depends on the primary
satellite-to-primary user associations. However, in practice, primary systems
have thus far not publicly disclosed their satellite assignment policies;
therefore, it becomes essential for secondary systems to develop methods to
infer such policies. Assuming there is limited historical data indicating which
primary satellites have served which primary users, we propose an end-to-end
graph structure learning-based algorithm for learning highest elevation primary
satellite assignment policies, that, upon deployment, can directly map the
primary satellite coordinates into assignment decisions for the primary users.
Simulation results show that our method can outperform the best baseline,
achieving approximately a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

### [3] [Delay-Augmented Stacked Intelligent Surfaces: Potential, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01411)
*Hibatallah Alwazani,Omran Abbas,Loic Markley,Anas Chaaban*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了延迟增强堆叠智能表面(DA-SIS)概念，通过在SIS中引入符号级延迟实现时空信号处理，展示了其作为模拟均衡器消除多径干扰的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统堆叠智能表面(SIS)仅支持空间波域信号处理，通过增加战略调谐的符号级延迟可以扩展其功能，实现时间域处理能力。

Method: 在SIS中集成延迟单元，构建延迟增强SIS(DA-SIS)，将其用作模拟均衡器来消除多径引起的符号间干扰。

Result: 通过误码率(BER)分析显示DA-SIS在均衡方面的有效性，与数字均衡器对比证明了其潜力。

Conclusion: DA-SIS为全息MIMO和超大规模MIMO技术提供了新的可能性，需要进一步研究来实现这一概念。

Abstract: Stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS)s have been proposed recently as an
enabling technology for Holographic Multiple Input Multiple Output (HMIMO) and
Ultra-massive MIMO (umMIMO) technologies. Their utility can extend beyond
spatial wave-domain processing of signals if they are enhanced with
strategically-tuned symbol-duration level delays to enable temporal processing
as well. In this work, we introduce the idea of a delay-augmented SIS (DA-SIS).
We shed light on the feasibility of realizing delay units in an SIS. Then, we
discuss the relevance of the proposed DA-SIS and present a use case that
illustrates its potential, wherein the DA-SIS serves as an analog equalizer
that aids in eliminating multi-path-induced inter-symbol-interference (ISI). We
show how the number of elements affect the equalization process using the bit
error rate (BER) as a metric, and demonstrate the potential of the DA-SIS in
equalization via comparing with digital equalizers as a benchmark. Finally, we
present opportunities and future research directions that can be undertaken to
bring this idea to fruition.

### [4] [A Drone-mounted Magnetometer System for Automatic Interference Removal and Landmine Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01417)
*Alex Paul Hoffmann,Matthew G. Finley,Eftyhia Zesta,Mark B. Moldwin,Lauro V. Ojeda*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无人机双磁力计的有效地雷检测方法，通过两步算法消除无人机电子设备干扰并检测地雷信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷在冲突地区长期威胁平民安全，阻碍战后重建。无人机磁力计检测面临电子设备干扰的技术挑战。

Method: 使用机载双磁力计载荷，采用WAIC-UP方法消除干扰，再用RUDE算法检测地雷特征。

Result: 该方法在蒙特卡洛模拟中实现了高保真度地雷检测，计算成本低，且能适应不同飞行高度。

Conclusion: WAIC-UP/RUDE双磁力计方法为地雷检测提供了高效可靠的解决方案，简化了磁测载荷设计。

Abstract: Landmines have been extensively used in conflict zones as an indiscriminate
weapon to control military movements, often remaining active long after
hostilities have ended. Their presence poses a persistent danger to civilians,
hindering post-war recovery efforts, causing injuries or death, and restricting
access to essential land for agriculture and infrastructure. Unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV) equipped with magnetometers are commonly used to detect remnant
hidden landmines but come with significant technical challenges due to magnetic
field interference from UAV electronics such as motors. We propose the use of a
frame-mounted UAV-borne two-magnetometer payload to perform a two-step
automated interference removal and landmine detection analysis. The first step
removes interference via the Wavelet-Adaptive Interference Cancellation for
Underdetermined Platform (WAIC-UP) method designed for spaceflight
magnetometers. The second method uses the Rapid Unsupervised Detection of
Events (RUDE) algorithm to detect landmine signatures. This two-step
WAIC-UP/RUDE approach with multiple magnetometers achieves high-fidelity
ordinance detection at a low computational cost and simplifies the design of
magnetic survey payloads. We validate the method through a Monte Carlo
simulation of randomized landmine placements in a 10 x 10 m square grid and
drone motor interference. Additionally, we assess the efficacy of the algorithm
by varying the drone's altitude, examining its performance at different heights
above the ground.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个基于可移动天线的全双工基站系统，同时为上下行用户提供通信服务并实现目标检测的感知功能，通过联合优化波束成形、用户发射功率和天线位置来最大化回波信干噪比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动集成感知与通信(ISAC)技术的发展，解决传统固定天线系统在同时支持通信和感知功能时的性能限制，利用可移动天线提升系统灵活性。

Method: 采用基于梯度的元学习(GML)方法来解决大规模非凸优化问题，联合优化发射波束成形向量、接收波束成形向量、上行用户发射功率和两个基站的可移动天线位置。

Result: 数值结果表明所提出的元学习方法能够达到最优解的99%性能，且基于可移动天线的方案优于多个基准方法。

Conclusion: 基于可移动天线的全双工ISAC系统在联合优化下能够有效提升感知性能，同时满足通信服务质量要求，为实际ISAC应用提供了优势解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a full-duplex (FD) scenario where a base station (BS)
equipped with movable antennas (MAs) simultaneously provides communication
services to a set of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users while also enabling
sensing functionalities for target detection, thereby supporting integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. Additionally, a receiving BS, also
equipped with MAs (denoted as BS R), is responsible for capturing the reflected
echo. To optimize this setup, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at
maximizing the signal-to-noise and interference ratio (SINR) of the captured
echo. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors
at the FD BS, the receiving beamforming vectors at both the FD BS and BS R, the
UL users' transmit power, and the MAs' positions at both BSs, all while
satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for both sensing and
communication. Given the non-convex nature of the problem and the high coupling
between the variables, we employ a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach
tailored for large-scale optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach, achieving results within
99% of the optimal solution. Furthermore, the MA-based scheme outperforms
several benchmark approaches, highlighting its advantages in practical ISAC
applications.

### [6] [The Analysis and Performance of LODC-OFDM Signal in Nonlinear Rydberg Atomic Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01605)
*Hao Wu,Xinyuan Yao,Rui Ni,Chen Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 针对里德堡原子传感器在OFDM接收中的单极性限制，提出了LODC-OFDM方案，通过分析非线性失真并推导闭式解，实验验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 里德堡原子传感器在射频测量中具有高灵敏度，但其光学接口的单极性特性限制了传统OFDM接收，需要开发兼容的单极性OFDM方案。

Method: 建立里德堡传感器的AM-AM特性经验近似函数，提出LODC-OFDM方案，采用Bussgang定理分析非线性失真，推导泰勒级数展开和理想预失真情况下的闭式解。

Result: 实验结果表明理论分析与实验结果吻合良好，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: LODC-OFDM方案成功解决了里德堡原子传感器的宽带OFDM接收挑战，为兼容信号传输提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors have been seen as novel radio frequency (RF)
measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it
attractive for communications reception. However, the signal sensing process in
Rydberg system involves sequential transduction from electromagnetic waves to
optical signals and finally to electrical signals. The unipolar characteristic
of the optical interface inherently restricts conventional OFDM reception.
Therefore, adopting unipolar OFDM schemes, inspired by optical communication
systems, becomes essential for compatible signal transmission. In this work, we
investigate the amplitude modulation-to-amplitude modulation (AM-AM)
characteristics of Rydberg atomic sensors, establishing an empirical
approximation function. Building on the direct current-biased optical
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) framework, we propose a
novel local oscillator direct current-biased OFDM (LODC-OFDM) scheme
specifically optimized for Rydberg-based sensing, effectively addressing the
broadband OFDM reception challenge. Then, we adopt Bussgang theorem to analyze
the nonlinear distortion of LODC-OFDM signals and the results in closed-form
solutions are derived for AM/AM curves approximated by Taylor series expansion
and for the ideal pre-distortion case. In real experiments, the experimental
and theoretical results fit well.

Method: 采用新颖的分析方法，推导1比特量化SIMO系统在QPSK调制和MRC接收下的精确SEP表达式。

Result: 获得了SIMO-MRC系统的精确SEP表达式，并确定了其分集增益和编码增益；同时量化了任意接收天线数下SIMO-SC系统的分集和编码增益。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展并完善了先前结果，为1比特量化SIMO系统提供了完整的性能分析框架。

Abstract: The average symbol error probability (SEP) of a 1-bit quantized single-input
multiple-output (SIMO) system is analyzed under Rayleigh fading channels and
quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Previous studies have
partially characterized the diversity gain for selection combining (SC). In
this paper, leveraging a novel analytical method, an exact analytical SEP
expression is derived for a 1-bit quantized SIMO system employing QPSK
modulation at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the
receiver. The corresponding diversity and coding gains of a SIMO-MRC system are
also determined. Furthermore, the diversity and coding gains of a 1-bit
quantized SIMO-SC system are quantified for an arbitrary number of receive
antennas, thereby extending and complementing prior results.

### [8] [3D 8-Ary Noise Modulation Using Bayesian- and Kurtosis-based Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01748)
*Hadi Zayyani,Felipe A. P. de Figueiredo,Mohammad Salman,Rausley A. A. de Souza*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的三维8进制噪声调制方案，通过引入高斯混合分布的概率维度，在均值和方差基础上增加第三维度，使每个符号传输3比特数据，数据率相比现有方案提高1.5-3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二维噪声调制方案数据率有限，需要开发更高维度的调制技术来提高数据传输效率。

Method: 使用高斯混合分布的概率作为第三调制维度，结合均值、方差形成三维调制。采用阈值检测器、最大似然检测器、峰度检测器和贝叶斯假设检测器分别检测三个子信道的比特。

Result: 仿真结果显示第三子信道比特的误码率与现有二维方案相当，数据率相比广义二次噪声调制器和经典二元KLJN噪声调制器分别提高1.5倍和3倍，峰度检测器能以较低复杂度实现约0.06的误码率。

Conclusion: 该三维调制方案成功提高了数据率，同时保持了可接受的误码率性能，峰度检测器提供了低复杂度的检测解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) 8-ary noise modulation
scheme that introduces a new dimension: the mixture probability of a Mixture of
Gaussian (MoG) distribution. This proposed approach utilizes the dimensions of
mean and variance, in addition to the new probability dimension. Within this
framework, each transmitted symbol carries three bits, each corresponding to a
distinct sub-channel. For detection, a combination of specialized detectors is
employed: a simple threshold based detector for the first sub-channel bit
(modulated by the mean), a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector for the second
sub-channel bit (modulated by the variance), a Kurtosis-based, Jarque-Bera (JB)
test, and Bayesian Hypothesis (BHT)-based detectors for the third bit
(modulated by the MoG probability). The Kurtosis- and JB-based detectors
specifically distinguish between Gaussian (or near-Gaussian) and non-Gaussian
MoG distributions by leveraging higher-order statistical measures. The Bit
Error Probabilities (BEPs) are derived for the threshold-, Kurtosis-, and
BHT-based detectors. The optimum threshold for the Kurtosis-based detector is
also derived in a tractable manner. Simulation results demonstrate that a
comparably low BEP is achieved for the third sub-channel bit relative to
existing two-dimensional (2D) schemes. Simultaneously, the proposed scheme
increases the data rate by a factor of 1.5 and 3 compared to the Generalized
Quadratic noise modulator and the classical binary KLJN noise modulator,
respectively. Furthermore, the Kurtosis-based detector offers a low-complexity
solution, achieving an acceptable BEP of approximately 0.06.

Conclusion: 该研究为Wasserstein距离约束下的鲁棒估计问题提供了理论分析和实用求解方法，通过有限维问题和线性估计器实现了有效的鲁棒估计。

Abstract: This paper primarily considers the robust estimation problem under
Wasserstein distance constraints on the parameter and noise distributions in
the linear measurement model with additive noise, which can be formulated as an
infinite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem. We prove that the existence of
a saddle point for this problem is equivalent to that for a finite-dimensional
minimax problem, and give a counterexample demonstrating that the saddle point
may not exist. Motivated by this observation, we present a verifiable necessary
and sufficient condition whose parameters can be derived from a convex problem
and its dual. Additionally, we also introduce a simplified sufficient
condition, which intuitively indicates that when the Wasserstein radii are
small enough, the saddle point always exists. In the absence of the saddle
point, we solve an finite-dimensional nonconvex minimax problem, obtained by
restricting the estimator to be linear. Its optimal value establishes an upper
bound on the robust estimation problem, while its optimal solution yields a
robust linear estimator. Numerical experiments are also provided to validate
our theoretical results.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出通过叠加两个广义二次噪声调制器(GQNM)输出创建16进制噪声调制器，类似经典通信中的QAM调制器，通过调制信息位到四个不同均值和方差上实现，性能优于KLJN和GQNM调制器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了创建更高阶的噪声调制方案，提高通信性能，通过叠加多个调制器输出实现类似经典通信中QAM调制器的功能。

Method: 将两个GQNM调制器的输出简单相加，创建16进制噪声调制器，调制信息位到四个不同均值和四个不同方差上，通过选择满足理论可区分性条件的参数来优化性能。

Result: 仿真验证表明，相比KLJN调制器和GQNM调制器，该方法能达到更好的性能，具体表现为更低的误码概率(BEP)。

Conclusion: 通过增加调制器、发射机和接收机检测器的复杂度，可以实现更小的误码概率，该方法可扩展到比16进制更高阶的调制方案，但更高阶调制需要进一步研究。

Abstract: This letter proposes superposing two Generalized Quadratic Noise Modulators
(GQNM) by simply adding their outputs. It creates a 16-ary noise modulator that
resembles QAM modulators in classical communication. It modulates the
information bits on four different means and four different variances. It could
also be applied to reach higher-order modulations than 16-ary schemes by adding
the outputs of more than two modulators, which is not discussed in detail in
this letter and left for future work. By selecting the parameters necessary for
satisfying the theoretical distinguishability conditions provided in the paper,
we can reach better performances in comparison to the Kirchhoff-Law Johnson
Noise (KLJN) modulator and the GQNM modulator, which is verified by the
simulations. The better result in terms of smaller Bit Error Probability (BEP)
is achieved by increasing the complexity in the modulator, the transmitter, and
the detectors in the receiver.

Abstract: In this paper, a single Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle (UAV)-aided localization
algorithm which uses both Doppler and Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements is
presented. In contrast to Doppler-based localization algorithms which are based
on non-convex functions, exploiting ToA measurements in a Least-Square (LS)
Doppler-based cost function, leads to a quadratic convex function whose
minimizer lies on a line. Utilizing the ToA measurements in addition to the
linear equation of minimizer, a closed form solution is obtained for the
emitter location using a constrained LS optimization. In addition, a trajectory
design of the UAV is provided which has also closed-form solution. Simulation
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in
comparison to some others in the literature.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) technology offers a flexible approach to enhancing
wireless channel conditions by adjusting antenna positions within a designated
region. While most existing works focus on narrowband MA systems, this paper
investigates MA position optimization for an MA-enhanced multiple-input
single-output (MISO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system.
This problem appears to be particularly challenging due to the frequency-flat
nature of MA positioning, which should accommodate the channel conditions
across different subcarriers. To overcome this challenge, we discretize the
movement region into a multitude of sampling points, thereby converting the
continuous position optimization problem into a discrete point selection
problem. Although this problem is combinatorial, we develop an efficient
partial enumeration algorithm to find the optimal solution using a
branch-and-bound framework, where a graph-theoretic method is incorporated to
effectively prune suboptimal solutions. In the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
regime, a simplified graph-based algorithm is also proposed to obtain the
optimal MA positions without the need for enumeration. Simulation results
reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed-position
antennas (FPAs), while narrowband-based antenna position optimization can
achieve near-optimal performance.

Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.

Motivation: 现有手势识别系统存在功耗高、仅支持离散手势分类的局限性，需要开发更节能、能连续追踪手势的系统。

Method: 使用8通道EMG和4通道A型US信号采集系统，结合轻量级编码器-解码器架构和多任务学习，同时估计手部和腕部关节角度。

Result: 在传感器重新定位条件下，EMG-US融合的均方根误差为10.6°±2.0°，优于单独使用EMG（12.0°±1°）或US（13.1°±2.6°）；R²得分为0.61±0.1，也优于单独模态。

Conclusion: EMG-US传感器融合方法能够实现更精确和鲁棒的手势连续追踪，为自然的人机交互提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition based on biosignals has shown strong potential for
developing intuitive human-machine interaction strategies that closely mimic
natural human behavior. In particular, sensor fusion approaches have gained
attention for combining complementary information and overcoming the
limitations of individual sensing modalities, thereby enabling more robust and
reliable systems. Among them, the fusion of surface electromyography (EMG) and
A-mode ultrasound (US) is very promising. However, prior solutions rely on
power-hungry platforms unsuitable for multi-day use and are limited to discrete
gesture classification. In this work, we present an ultra-low-power (sub-50 mW)
system for concurrent acquisition of 8-channel EMG and 4-channel A-mode US
signals, integrating two state-of-the-art platforms into fully wearable,
dry-contact armbands. We propose a framework for continuous tracking of 23
degrees of freedom (DoFs), 20 for the hand and 3 for the wrist, using a
kinematic glove for ground-truth labeling. Our method employs lightweight
encoder-decoder architectures with multi-task learning to simultaneously
estimate hand and wrist joint angles. Experimental results under realistic
sensor repositioning conditions demonstrate that EMG-US fusion achieves a root
mean squared error of $10.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$, compared to
$12.0^\circ\pm1^\circ$ for EMG and $13.1^\circ\pm2.6^\circ$ for US, and a R$^2$
score of $0.61\pm0.1$, with $0.54\pm0.03$ for EMG and $0.38\pm0.20$ for US.

Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper
proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named
Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for
communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions
can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In
particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and
computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by
precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC
principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the
evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE)
performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results
validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate
(BER) and MSE.

Method: 提出JMD范式，通过联合估计干扰子空间和检测多时隙合法传输数据，无需专用训练阶段。开发了SANDMAN和MAED两种算法，采用不同的信道估计方法以实现不同的复杂度-性能权衡。

Conclusion: JMD提供了一种无需专用训练阶段的干扰抑制解决方案，能够有效应对传统方法无法处理的智能干扰器，同时避免了通信速率的损失。

Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of
jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of
its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This
strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no
data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by
smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase
or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To
address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection
(JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to
estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the
legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need
for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate
smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms,
SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the
legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs.
Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFDM在高移动性场景中表现出优越性能，但现有设计在安全性方面存在不足。需要开发能够动态变化波形参数以增强物理层安全性的系统。

Method: 使用长周期伪噪声序列控制码本，动态生成AFDM预啁啾参数，采用参数域扩展而非数据域扩展，并提出同步框架解决时变参数在快速时变信道中的同步问题。

Result: 理论推导证明未同步的窃听者无法消除时变参数的非线性影响，仿真结果显示SE-AFDM在高移动性场景中具有安全优势，硬件原型验证了同步框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SE-AFDM系统通过动态参数变化成功增强了物理层安全性，同时保持了AFDM在高移动性场景中的性能优势，为未来无线通信系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant
attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled
with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for
system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division
multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically
varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the
SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a
codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of
applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach
provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum
efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of
reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast
time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized
eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying
parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation
results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in
high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the
effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.

Conclusion: 提出的三极化连续孔径阵列框架能够有效实现联合波达方向和姿态估计，在有无先验知识的情况下都能获得良好的估计性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and attitude sensing
using tri-polarized continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs). By employing
electromagnetic (EM) information theory, the spatially continuous received
signals in tri-polarized CAPA are modeled, thereby enabling accurate DOA and
attitude estimation. To facilitate subspace decomposition for continuous
operators, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation technique is
developed. Moreover, both self- and cross-covariances of tri-polarized signals
are exploited to construct a tri-polarized spectrum, significantly enhancing
DOA estimation performance. Theoretical analyses reveal that the
identifiability of attitude information fundamentally depends on the
availability of prior target snapshots. Accordingly, two attitude estimation
algorithms are proposed: one capable of estimating partial attitude information
without prior knowledge, and the other achieving full attitude estimation when
such knowledge is available. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and
superiority of the proposed framework.

<details>

Motivation: 集成感知与通信(ISAC)部署带来了前所未有的授权感知漏洞，需要开发安全解决方案来防止未经授权的被动雷达感知窃听者提取敏感信息。

Method: 在ISAC信号的模糊函数中引入人工缺陷，通过结构化的子载波功率分配方案设计安全自相关函数，插入周期性峰值来误导窃听者的距离估计。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了感知安全，通过优化问题在保证一定感知安全水平的同时最大化ISAC性能，展示了通信、合法感知和感知安全之间的三向权衡。

Abstract: The deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) brings along
unprecedented vulnerabilities to authorized sensing, necessitating the
development of secure solutions. Sensing parameters are embedded within the
target-reflected signal leaked to unauthorized passive radar sensing
eavesdroppers (Eve), implying that they can silently extract sensory
information without prior knowledge of the information data. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a sensing-secure ISAC framework that ensures secure
target detection and estimation for the legitimate system, while obfuscating
unauthorized sensing without requiring any prior knowledge of Eve. By
introducing artificial imperfections into the ambiguity function (AF) of ISAC
signals, we introduce artificial targets into Eve's range profile which
increase its range estimation ambiguity. In contrast, the legitimate sensing
receiver (Alice) can suppress these AF artifacts using mismatched filtering,
albeit at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss. Employing an OFDM
signal, a structured subcarrier power allocation scheme is designed to shape
the secure autocorrelation function (ACF), inserting periodic peaks to mislead
Eve's range estimation and degrade target detection performance. To quantify
the sensing security, we introduce peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated
sidelobe level (ISL) as key performance metrics. Then, we analyze the three-way
trade-offs between communication, legitimate sensing, and sensing security,
highlighting the impact of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC signaling on system
performance. We formulate a convex optimization problem to maximize ISAC
performance while guaranteeing a certain sensing security level. Numerical
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-secure ISAC
signaling, demonstrating its ability to degrade Eve's target estimation while
preserving Alice's performance.

Abstract: Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.

### [21] [An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01361)
*Conall Daly,Darren Ramsook,Anil Kokaram*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频帧插值质量评估指标PSNR_DIV，通过运动发散加权增强PSNR，在BVI-VFI数据集上相比FloLPIPS提升0.09皮尔逊相关系数，同时速度快2.5倍、内存使用减少4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频帧插值质量评估指标（如PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS）忽略时间一致性，而专门针对帧插值的指标如FloLPIPS存在计算效率低的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出PSNR_DIV指标，通过运动发散加权技术增强PSNR，该技术源自档案胶片修复领域，用于检测时间不一致性，通过突出运动场中的奇点来加权图像误差。

Result: 在BVI-VFI数据集（180个序列，涵盖多种帧率、分辨率和插值方法）上的评估显示，PSNR_DIV相比FloLPIPS皮尔逊线性相关系数提升0.09，速度快2.5倍，内存使用减少4倍，在所有内容类别中性能一致且对运动估计器具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PSNR_DIV的高效性和准确性使其能够快速进行质量评估，并可作为训练神经网络进行视频帧插值任务的实用损失函数。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video
enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual
impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and
LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored
towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but
suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application.
We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric
that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted
from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal
inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which
is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180
sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods)
shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant
improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while
being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains
consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator
used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast
quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural
networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric
is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出Median2Median（M2M）零样本去噪框架，专门针对结构化噪声设计，通过创新的采样策略生成伪独立子图像对，无需干净标签数据即可有效去除相关噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像常受强各向异性相关的结构化噪声影响，现有方法对此处理效果有限。数据驱动方法依赖高质量标签且泛化性差，而零样本方法仅适用于独立同分布噪声。需要填补这一空白。

Method: M2M引入新颖采样策略：1）使用方向插值和广义中值滤波自适应排除结构化伪影；2）采用随机分配策略扩大有效采样空间并消除系统偏差；3）生成适合Noise2Noise训练的伪独立子图像对。

Result: 在真实模拟研究中，M2M在独立同分布噪声下与最先进零样本方法表现相当，在相关噪声下始终优于这些方法。

Conclusion: M2M是结构化噪声抑制的高效、无数据解决方案，标志着零样本去噪首次突破严格独立同分布假设限制的重要进展。

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical
imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with
strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most
data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and
still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods
avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median
(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M
introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent
sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional
interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values
distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling
space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is
employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for
Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par
with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently
outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an
efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the
first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d.
assumption.

TL;DR: GFSR-Net是一种改进医学影像可解释性的方法，使用少量人工标注引导模型关注与诊断相关的图像区域，提高可靠性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像分析中缺乏可解释性，模型可能依赖与疾病无关的图像区域或非真实视觉线索，这会降低临床信任度并增加误诊风险。

Method: 使用少量人工标注近似人类直觉关注区域，无需精确边界或详尽标记。模型在训练过程中学习将注意力与这些区域对齐，逐步强调具有诊断意义的特征。

Result: GFSR-Net在胸片、视网膜扫描和皮肤图像等多种医学影像上达到相当或更优的准确率，产生的显著图更符合人类预期，减少了对无关模式的依赖。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了自动化诊断工具的可信度，通过引导注意力机制增强了医学影像分析的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis,
however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of
interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without
explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to
the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in
real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of
misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance
Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and
reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human
annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image
intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,
making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to
align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry
diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and
medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological
images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior
accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations.
This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in
automated diagnostic tools.

Conclusion: MSRepaint提供了一个统一的解决方案，通过双向病变填充和合成能力，有效改善多发性硬化症MRI分析的下游任务性能，并支持高保真度的纵向病变演化模拟。

Abstract: In multiple sclerosis, lesions interfere with automated magnetic resonance
imaging analyses such as brain parcellation and deformable registration, while
lesion segmentation models are hindered by the limited availability of
annotated training data. To address both issues, we propose MSRepaint, a
unified diffusion-based generative model for bidirectional lesion filling and
synthesis that restores anatomical continuity for downstream analyses and
augments segmentation through realistic data generation. MSRepaint conditions
on spatial lesion masks for voxel-level control, incorporates contrast dropout
to handle missing inputs, integrates a repainting mechanism to preserve
surrounding anatomy during lesion filling and synthesis, and employs a
multi-view DDIM inversion and fusion pipeline for 3D consistency with fast
inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MSRepaint
across multiple tasks. For lesion filling, we evaluate both the accuracy within
the filled regions and the impact on downstream tasks including brain
parcellation and deformable registration. MSRepaint outperforms the traditional
lesion filling methods FSL and NiftySeg, and achieves accuracy on par with
FastSurfer-LIT, a recent diffusion model-based inpainting method, while
offering over 20 times faster inference. For lesion synthesis, state-of-the-art
MS lesion segmentation models trained on MSRepaint-synthesized data outperform
those trained on CarveMix-synthesized data or real ISBI challenge training data
across multiple benchmarks, including the MICCAI 2016 and UMCL datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that MSRepaint's unified bidirectional filling and
synthesis capability, with full spatial control over lesion appearance, enables
high-fidelity simulation of lesion evolution in longitudinal MS progression.

Motivation: 解决医学影像中DNN因学习虚假相关性而非有意义的医学模式而导致的泛化问题，现有数据集缺乏系统研究这一问题的能力。

Method: 分析了100多个涉及患者、设备和成像协议的特征，识别出两个主要的虚假信号：磁场强度（全局特征）和图像方向（局部特征），通过受控的数据集分割来研究这些信号的影响。

Result: 研究表明DNN可以利用这些非临床信号获得高验证准确率，但在无偏测试数据上泛化失败。

Conclusion: SpurBreast数据集为研究人员提供了系统研究临床相关和无关特征、不确定性估计、对抗鲁棒性和泛化策略的平台。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical
imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious
correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of
meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed
to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and
limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce
SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates
spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing
over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify
two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature
influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting
spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs
can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy
while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets
containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without
spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate
clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation,
adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are

Motivation: 扩散模型在解决逆成像问题时依赖缓慢的多步采样，限制了实际应用。一致性模型虽然能实现少步高质量生成，但在逆问题中的直接应用研究不足。

Method: 修改一致性采样方法，通过测量一致性机制引导采样器的随机性，该机制与测量算子相关联，在保持一致性生成效率的同时强制满足测量数据的保真度。

Result: 在Fashion-MNIST和LSUN Bedroom数据集上的实验显示，相比基线一致性采样，在感知和像素级指标（FID、KID、PSNR、SSIM）上均有持续改进，仅需少量步骤就能获得竞争性或更优的重建结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够以少量步骤实现高质量的逆问题重建，在保持效率的同时显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse
imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits
practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling
high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct
adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a
modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem
reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a
measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which
enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency
of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level
metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance,
peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared
to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior
reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key
technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it
faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the
number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of
next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing
these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver
architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike
existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our
MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable
to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection,
and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability,
and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed
approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby
enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be
seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the
development of fully intelligent communication receivers.

Conclusion: 代数构造方法能够有效构建满足多种约束条件的高质量DNA码，但仍存在许多开放研究方向，需要进一步探索DNA码的代数界限和多约束条件下的构造方法。

Abstract: DNA strings and their properties are widely studied since last 20 years due
to its applications in DNA computing. In this area, one designs a set of DNA
strings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and
combinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement
constraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent
applications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints
on DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of
non-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint.
Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed
constraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement,
$GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem
repeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are
constructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and
combinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring
and a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA
codes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic
constructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields
DNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We
briefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance
etc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that
satisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about
algebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present
some open research directions in this area.

*Li Wan,Huarui Yin,Wenyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出基于错误模式树(EP tree)的并行SGRAND解码器和混合GRAND算法，在保持最大似然解码性能的同时显著降低解码延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软GRAND(SGRAND)虽然能实现最大似然解码，但其顺序执行特性阻碍了并行化，导致高解码延迟。随着并行硬件平台的发展，需要开发能够满足高吞吐量和低延迟要求的高效通用解码器。

Method: 1. 使用统一的二进制错误模式树(EP tree)表示错误模式，支持紧凑表示、高效操作和并行探索；2. 基于EP tree设计并行SGRAND，通过剪枝策略和基于树的计算保持ML最优性；3. 开发混合GRAND算法，将EP tree表示与有序可靠性位(ORB)GRAND结合。

Result: 数值实验表明：并行SGRAND相比串行实现获得3.75倍加速，混合增强方法获得4.8倍加速，且在硬件映射下预期会有更大增益。

Conclusion: EP tree表示为GRAND解码器提供了有效的并行化框架，在保持最大似然解码性能的同时显著提升了解码速度，为满足现代通信系统的高吞吐量和低延迟要求提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Advances in parallel hardware platforms have motivated the development of
efficient universal decoders capable of meeting stringent throughput and
latency requirements. Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a
recently proposed decoding paradigm that sequentially tests Error Patterns
(EPs) until finding a valid codeword. While Soft GRAND (SGRAND) achieves
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding, its inherently sequential nature hinders
parallelism and results in high decoding latency. In this work, we utilize a
unified binary tree representation of EPs, termed the EP tree, which enables
compact representation, efficient manipulation, and parallel exploration.
Building upon this EP tree representation, we propose a parallel design of
SGRAND, preserving its ML optimality while significantly reducing decoding
latency through pruning strategies and tree-based computation. Furthermore, we
develop a hybrid GRAND algorithm that enhances Ordered Reliability Bits (ORB)
GRAND with the EP tree representation, thereby achieving ML decoding with
minimal additional computational cost beyond ORBGRAND while retaining parallel
efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that parallel SGRAND achieves a
$3.75\times$ acceleration compared to serial implementation, while the hybrid
enhanced method achieves a $4.8\times$ acceleration, with further gains
expected under hardware mapping.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了BCH码的维数和Bose距离，针对长度为$(q^m-1)/\lambda$的BCH码，在更大范围内推导了维数和Bose距离的显式公式，并发现了具有良好参数的BCH码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCH码是重要的纠错码，具有强大的代数结构和多错误纠正能力，但其参数（包括维数、最小距离和Bose距离）在一般情况下仍未知。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 研究长度为$(q^m-1)/\lambda$的BCH码，其中$\lambda$是$q-1$的正因子。对于$m\geq 4$的窄带BCH码，在更大设计距离范围内推导维数和Bose距离的显式公式，并将结果扩展到某些非窄带BCH码。

Result: 获得了BCH码维数和Bose距离的显式公式，设计距离范围$2\leq\delta\leq(q^{\lfloor(2m-1)/3\rfloor+1}-1)/{\lambda}+1$比先前已知结果更大。发现了多个具有良好参数的BCH码。

Conclusion: 本文在更大范围内确定了BCH码的维数和Bose距离，扩展了先前结果，并识别了具有良好参数的BCH码，为BCH码的理论研究和实际应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: BCH codes are important error correction codes, widely utilized due to their
robust algebraic structure, multi-error correcting capability, and efficient
decoding algorithms. Despite their practical importance and extensive study,
their parameters, including dimension, minimum distance and Bose distance,
remain largely unknown in general. This paper addresses this challenge by
investigating the dimension and Bose distance of BCH codes of length $(q^m -
1)/\lambda$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\lambda$ is a positive
divisor of $q - 1$. Specifically, for narrow-sense BCH codes of this length
with $m \geq 4$, we derive explicit formulas for their dimension for designed
distance $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}
+ 1$. We also provide explicit formulas for their Bose distance in the range $2
\leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}$. These
ranges for $\delta$ are notably larger than the previously known results for
this class of BCH codes. Furthermore, we extend these findings to determine the
dimension and Bose distance for certain non-narrow-sense BCH codes of the same
length. Applying our results, we identify several BCH codes with good
parameters.

Conclusion: 提出的RUOM算法有效解决了RIS增强无人机网络中NOMA通信的公平性和资源效率问题，为实际部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of downlink non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) communication in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks enhanced
by partitionable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We analyze three
types of links between base station (BS) and UAVs: direct, RIS-only indirect,
and composite links, under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS)
propagation. The RIS-only indirect link and direct link are modeled using
double Nakagami-m and Nakagami-m fading, respectively, while the composite link
follows a combined fading channel model. Closed-form expressions for the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are derived for all links, enabling tractable outage probability
analysis. Then, we formulate a fairness-efficiency bilevel optimization problem
to minimize the maximum outage probability among UAVs while minimizing the
total number of required RIS reflecting elements. Accordingly, an RIS-assisted
UAV Outage Minimization (RUOM) algorithm is proposed, which fairly allocates
the NOMA power coefficients while minimizing the total number of RIS reflecting
elements required, subject to NOMA-defined constraints, RIS resource
limitations, and maximum allowable outage threshold. Simulation results
validate the analytical models and demonstrate that the proposed RUOM algorithm
significantly improves fairness and efficiency in BS-UAV communication.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.

Abstract: Quantum sensing has attracted significant attention due to its ability to
measure physical quantities with extremely high accuracy. Rydberg atoms -
typically alkali atoms with a highly excited valence electron that is far from
the nucleus - exhibit strong sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields.
This sensitivity leads to coupling between different atomic energy levels,
which can be observed by monitoring changes in a control laser beam before and
after it passes through a vapor cell containing the Rydberg atoms. By analyzing
the transmitted laser signal with a photodetector, variations in transmission
can be attributed to the presence and characteristics of the external
electromagnetic field. Because Rydberg atoms operate in a highly excited
quantum state without relying on traditional electronic circuitry, they
inherently avoid thermal noise, thereby enabling more sensitive detection. In
this paper, we investigate the performance of a Rydberg atomic receiver based
on Rb-85 and compare it with that of a conventional receiver in detecting an
8-level pulse amplitude modulation (8-PAM) signal in the presence of
off-resonant interference. We demonstrate that the Rydberg receiver can
suppress interference without the need for an additional filter. Effectively,
our results show that the Rydberg receiver serves as an integrated filter and
demodulator, outperforming conventional circuit-based receivers in terms of
achievable symbol error rate

Conclusion: 无线协作边缘推理需要联合考虑语义相关性和信道状态，联合方法能显著提升在恶劣传播条件下的推理性能。

Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables
multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence
of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information
exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of
wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a
disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or
channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation
conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes
into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping
devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of
the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the
joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared
to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider
application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.

Conclusion: 协作推理框架通过选择合适的协作点和通信策略，可以在保持准确性的同时有效管理通信资源。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge
ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve
classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw
observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to
balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism
for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference
by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of
intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off
across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect
performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to
optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the
intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the
query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data
transmission itself.
