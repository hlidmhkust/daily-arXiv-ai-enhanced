However, these single-filter models suffer from a \"compromise\" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing \"Decoupled Spectral Flexibility.\" DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental \"Flexibility-Stability Trade-off\". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the \"compromise\" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer.

Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GegenbauerNet\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u5355\u4e00\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6298\u8877\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8c31GNN\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027-\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7684L-JacobiNet\u56e0\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800cS-JacobiNet\u867d\u7136\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGegenbauer\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6784\u5efaGNN\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4f46\u5141\u8bb8\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e00\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570lambda\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u56fa\u5b9a\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "GegenbauerNet\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4efb\u52a1(K=2)\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u800cL-JacobiNet\u5728\u9ad8K\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u57287\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728[-1,1]\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8\u6027(K)\u548c\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3aGNN\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods.

Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOPE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6267\u884c\u58f0\u7eb3\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5e72\u51c0-\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6216\u5408\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u4e0a\u884c\u5e26\u5bbd\u51cf\u5c1180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\u58f0\u7eb3\u5728\u6c34\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u6311\u6218\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u5e26\u5bbd\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u8fbe98%\u5e27\u7684\u58f0\u7eb3\u7279\u5b9a\u4f2a\u5f71\uff08\u6591\u70b9\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6df7\u54cd\u3001\u58f0\u5b66\u9634\u5f71\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7801\u672c\u538b\u7f29\uff08ACC\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u9891\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\uff08FAMS\uff09\u5c06\u5e27\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4e\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u9891\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u5feb\u901f\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u51b2\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u6307\u5bfc\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u6708\u7684\u73b0\u573aARIS\u58f0\u7eb3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSCOPE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.77\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\uff08SSIM\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53bb\u566a\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8640%\uff0c\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4f4e\u81f3<=0.0118 bpp\u3002\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u884c\u5e26\u5bbd80%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e0b\u6e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u58f0\u7eb3\u6d41\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ec6\u8282\u3002"}}

We propose an efficient alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain the optimal end-to-end transmission response of the SIM for all orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers. Drawing an analogy between the layered SIM architecture and deep neural networks, we define a beampattern- matching loss, derive analytical gradients for backpropagation, and implement a learning-based optimization of the SIM coefficients using a mini-batch Adam optimizer. A complexity analysis is provided, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed CR-ISAC framework.

However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPoCGM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06PFGM++\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11CT\u6295\u5f71\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u5c06PFGM++\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u9636\u6bb5\u6574\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5168\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aPoCGM\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f2a\u5f71\u6291\u5236\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u5242\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "PoCGM\u6210\u529f\u5c06PFGM++\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Each user holds a private input and aims to compute the sum of all other users' inputs, while satisfying the security constraint that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users, can infer any information about the inputs beyond the recovered sum. To ensure security, users are equipped with secret keys to mask their inputs. Motivated by recent advances in efficient group-based key generation protocols, we consider the symmetric groupwise key setting, where every subset of $G$ users shares a group key that is independent of all other group keys. The problem is challenging because the recovery and security constraints must hold simultaneously for all users, and the structural constraints on the secret keys limit the flexibility of key correlations. We characterize the optimal rate region consisting of all achievable pairs of per-user broadcast communication rate and groupwise key rate. In particular, we show that DSA with groupwise keys is infeasible when $G=1$ or $G\\ge K-T$. Otherwise, when $2\\le G<K-T$, to securely compute one symbol of the desired sum, each user must broadcast at least one symbol, and each group key must contain at least $(K-T-2)/\\binom{K-T-1}{G}$ independent symbols. Our results establish the fundamental limits of DSA with groupwise keys and provide design insights for communication- and key-efficient secure aggregation in decentralized learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u548c\u6297\u5408\u8c0b\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u548c\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5bc6\u94a5\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u5dee\u9519\u5e7f\u64ad\u4fe1\u9053\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u6301\u6709\u79c1\u5bc6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86DSA\u5728\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u5f53G=1\u6216G\u2265K-T\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u5f532\u2264G<K-T\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u81f3\u5c11\u5e7f\u64ad1\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u81f3\u5c11\u5305\u542b(K-T-2)/C(K-T-1,G)\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u7ec4\u5bc6\u94a5\u4e0bDSA\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5bc6\u94a5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u6563\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u53cd\u5c04\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u53c9\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u6563\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u53cd\u5c04\u8def\u5f84\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u51fa\u53d1\u89d2\u548c\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u5f84\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5feb\u901fTurbo\u53d8\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0cSF-TVBI\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eTurbo-VBI\u76f8\u5f53\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u53cd\u5c04\u8def\u5f84\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\u548cSF-TVBI\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002"}}

Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency.

Among these, a recent line of work has demonstrated strong performance by formulating sampling as an optimization procedure that enforces measurement consistency, forward diffusion consistency, and both step-wise and backward diffusion consistency. However, these methods have only considered 2D reconstruction tasks and do not directly extend to 3D image reconstruction problems, such as in Computed Tomography (CT). To bridge this gap, we propose NEtwork-Regularized diffusion sampling for 3D CT (NERD) by incorporating an L1 regularization into the optimization objective. This regularizer encourages spatial continuity across adjacent slices, reducing inter-slice artifacts and promoting coherent volumetric reconstructions. Additionally, we introduce two efficient optimization strategies to solve the resulting objective: one based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and another based on the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method.

However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots.

However, acquiring reliable channel state information (CSI) in LEO satellite communication remains challenging owing to severe signal attenuation over long propagation distances and short coherence times. Despite these challenges, LEO channels benefit from pronounced line-of-sight dominance and geometric properties inherently tied to positioning information. In this work, we propose an integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework for multi-LEO satellite networks to address the unique challenges posed by LEO channels. Specifically, we leverage in-the-loop LEO positioning to exploit users' position information for improving uplink CSI acquisition. To overcome the link-budget limitations of single-satellite systems, cooperative multi-LEO uplink data detection is adopted. By exploiting the different coherent timescales of position-related parameters and random channel gains, we develop a dual-timescale Kalman filter-based IPAC framework: an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for tracking users' position and velocity in the large-timescale, and a Kalman filter that leverages the position information obtained in the large-timescale for improved data-aided uplink channel estimation in the small-timescale. Finally, the two tasks of channel estimation and cooperative data detection are jointly addressed through the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IPAC approach outperforms the conventional baseline in terms of channel estimation accuracy and communication performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1(IPAC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LEO\u536b\u661f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6539\u5584\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LEO\u536b\u661f\u901a\u4fe1\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46LEO\u4fe1\u9053\u5177\u6709\u89c6\u8ddd\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6539\u5584\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7528\u6237\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5229\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IPAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528LEO\u536b\u661f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To achieve this goal, we propose a two-phase approach. In Phase I, each receive BS recovers an individual image based on the sample covariance matrix of its received signals. Specifically, we propose a novel covariance-based imaging framework to jointly estimate effective scattering intensity and grid positions, which reduces the number of estimated parameters leveraging channel statistical properties and allows grid adjustment to conform to target geometry. In Phase II, the CPU fuses the individual images of all the receivers to construct a high-quality image of all the targets. Specifically, we design edge-preserving natural neighbor interpolation (EP-NNI) to map individual heterogeneous images onto common and finer grids, and then propose a joint optimization framework to estimate fused scattering intensity and BS fields of view.

In contrast to conventional sub-connected (SC) PASS, the proposed FC architecture employs a tunable phase-shifter network to interconnect all radio frequency (RF) chains with all waveguides. This facilitates a THB framework that integrates conventional hybrid analog-digital beamforming with pinching beamforming. A weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamformers and pinching antenna (PA) positions. Two algorithms are developed to address this challenging non-convex problem. 1) Fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm: This algorithm directly maximizes the WSR using an FP-based alternating optimization framework. Particularly, a success-history based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE) method is proposed to optimize PA positions, effectively addressing the intractable multimodal objective function. 2) Zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm: To reduce design complexity, zero-forcing is employed for transmit beamforming. The PA positions are subsequently optimized to maximize the WSR via a modified SHADE method.

To support this emerging field while remaining compatible with existing network architectures, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) based on 5G New Radio (NR) signals is regarded as a promising solution. However, merely leveraging standard 5G NR signals, such as the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), presents fundamental limitations in sensing resolution. To address the issue, this paper proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine sensing framework that utilizes standard 5G NR initial access signals augmented by a custom-designed sparse pilot structure (SPS) for high-precision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) sensing. In Stage I, we first fuse information from the SSB, Type\\#0-PDCCH, and system information block 1 (SIB1) to ensure the initial target detection. In Stage II, a refined estimation algorithm is introduced to overcome the resolution limitations of these signals. Inspired by the sparse array theory, this stage employs a novel SPS, which is inserted into resource blocks (RBs) within the CORSET\\#0 bandwidth. To accurately extract the off-grid range and velocity parameters from these sparse pilots, we develop a corresponding high-resolution algorithm based on the weighted unwrapped phase (WUP) technique and the RELAX-based iterative method. Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adopted to prune the redundant detections arising from beam overlap. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in comparison to other techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e5G NR\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u521d\u59cb\u63a5\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u9891\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSSB\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u5174\u5e94\u7528\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e5G NR\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1(ISAC)\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6SSB\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408SSB\u3001Type#0-PDCCH\u548cSIB1\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u9635\u5217\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u9891\u7ed3\u6784(SPS)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u89e3\u7f20\u76f8\u4f4d(WUP)\u6280\u672f\u548cRELAX\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528DBSCAN\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fee\u526a\u5197\u4f59\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e865G NR\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7a7a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684ISAC\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
