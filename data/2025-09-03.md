<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多导睡眠图(PSG)诊断睡眠呼吸暂停成本高、操作复杂且影响睡眠质量，需要开发更便捷的家庭自动化检测方法

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)处理单通道EEG数据，结合IIR巴特沃斯滤波器预处理、数据集构建方法提供时间上下文，并使用SMOTETomek处理类别不平衡问题

Result: 模型达到85.1%的准确率和0.22的Matthews相关系数，显示出良好的检测性能

Conclusion: 该方法证明了从传统实验室诊断向家庭自动化解决方案过渡的可行性，能改善患者预后并提高睡眠障碍诊断的可及性

Abstract: Sleep apnea, a prevalent sleep disorder, involves repeated episodes of
breathing interruptions during sleep, leading to various health complications,
including cognitive impairments, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke,
and even death. One of the main challenges in diagnosing and treating sleep
apnea is identifying individuals at risk. The current gold standard for
diagnosis, Polysomnography (PSG), is costly, labor intensive, and inconvenient,
often resulting in poor quality sleep data. This paper presents a novel
approach to the detection of sleep apnea using a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained on single channel EEG data. The proposed CNN achieved an accuracy
of 85.1% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.22, demonstrating a
significant potential for home based applications by addressing the limitations
of PSG in automated sleep apnea detection. Key contributions of this work also
include the development of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline with an
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth filter, a dataset construction
method providing broader temporal context, and the application of SMOTETomek to
address class imbalance. This research underscores the feasibility of
transitioning from traditional laboratory based diagnostics to more accessible,
automated home based solutions, improving patient outcomes and broadening the
accessibility of sleep disorder diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的先进步态分析方法通常需要鞋部安装传感器，限制了日常使用。手腕穿戴设备（如智能手表）更便捷，但信号格式不兼容

Method: 采用条件生成对抗网络（GANs），包括传统二元交叉熵损失训练的GAN和Wasserstein GAN（WGAN），生成器测试了卷积自编码器和卷积U-Net两种架构

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够准确实现信号转换，使手腕传感器信号可用于高效的日常步态分析

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了手腕与鞋部传感器信号兼容性问题，为基于智能穿戴设备的日常步态监测提供了可行方案

Abstract: The paper presents an approach in which inertial signals measured with a
wrist-worn sensor (e.g., a smartwatch) are translated into those that would be
recorded using a shoe-mounted sensor, enabling the use of state-of-the-art gait
analysis methods. In the study, the signals are translated using Conditional
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two different GAN versions are used for
experimental verification: traditional ones trained using binary cross-entropy
loss and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs). For the generator, two architectures, a
convolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The
experiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate
translation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient,
every-day gait analysis.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出基于流体天线的物理层密钥生成系统，通过优化预编码矩阵和天线位置，在恶劣传播环境中显著提升密钥生成率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在恶劣传播环境中，无线信道特性变差，传统物理层密钥生成技术的密钥生成率显著下降，需要新的解决方案

Method: 推导流体天线阵列的密钥生成率闭式表达式，使用粒子群优化算法联合优化预编码矩阵和天线位置，并开发交替优化算法降低计算复杂度

Result: 相比传统均匀平面天线阵列，在PSO算法下实现35.42%的KGR性能提升，在AO算法下实现67.73%的KGR性能提升

Conclusion: 流体天线通过提供额外的空间自由度，在物理层密钥生成方面优于传统固定位置天线阵列和可重构智能表面，是解决恶劣环境下密钥生成率下降的有效方案

Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key
generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless
channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation
environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key
generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose
a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.
Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA
array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions
via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the
computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an
alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient
descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting
the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is
superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna
(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth
highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),
the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO
algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力测量是分析人体运动的重要工具，传感器鞋垫作为可穿戴移动解决方案，在糖尿病足监测、康复指导、辅助设备控制和运动表现分析等领域有广泛应用需求。

Method: 通过系统文献综述，评估现有传感器技术（电阻式、电容式、电感式、压电式、摩擦电式和光学传感），分析传感器数量与布局、参与者群体、参考标准，特别关注创新设计和步行实验支持的研究。

Result: 发现当前研究缺乏适当的传感器校准、基于步态的验证和人体研究验证；识别出组织刚度是传感器信号不确定性的关键来源；提出了基于测试设备和仪器化跑步机的黄金标准以确保研究可比性。

Conclusion: 提出了传感器尺寸和不显眼鞋垫设计的指南以促进自然步态；未来方向包括开发多模态传感器以补偿单一模式的局限性，以及捕捉压力分布中剪切分量的多轴传感新趋势。

Abstract: Plantar pressure measurement, or pedobarography, is an essential tool for
analyzing human motion in healthy individuals and patients. Across the reviewed
literature, sensor insoles are motivated as wearable, mobile solutions for
assessing pressure distribution in applications including diabetic foot
monitoring, rehabilitation guidance, assistive device control, and sports
performance analysis. This review evaluates the current state of the art with
particular attention to sensor technologies, sensor quantity and placement,
participant cohorts, and reference standards. The focus lies on original works
with innovative designs, preferably supported by ambulation experiments. The
modalities covered include resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric,
triboelectric, and optical sensing approaches. We identify a lack of proper
sensor calibration, gait-based verification, and human study validation, and
propose a gold standard based on testing machines and instrumented treadmills
to ensure comparability across studies. The bidirectional interaction between
insole insertion and foot-sole mechanics is examined, with tissue stiffness
identified as a key source of uncertainty in sensor signals. Guidelines are
provided for sensor dimensions and unobtrusive insole designs to foster natural
gait. Finally, future directions include the development of multimodal sensors
to compensate for limitations of individual modalities and the emerging trend
of multiaxial sensing for capturing shear components in pressure distributions.

### [5] [CoMET: A Contrastive-Masked Brain Foundation Model for Universal EEG Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00314)

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CoMET是一个基于掩码自编码器和对比学习的脑电基础模型，通过镜像尺度增强提升全局判别能力，在10个下游任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑电自监督模型过度依赖掩码重建策略，关注局部信号相似性特征而忽视对下游任务至关重要的全局判别模式

Method: 采用重新设计分块和嵌入的掩码自编码器作为骨干网络，设计带有镜像尺度增强的对比学习框架来增强全局判别能力

Result: 在3000多名受试者的100多万个样本上预训练，在10个不同下游数据集上评估均达到SOTA结果

Conclusion: CoMET在提取通用脑电表征方面具有卓越能力，展现出强大的临床潜力

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
activity, widely used in brain-computer interfaces, clinic, and healthcare.
Traditional EEG deep models typically focus on specific dataset and task,
limiting model size and generalization. Recently, self-supervised brain
foundation models have emerged and been applied to various downstream tasks.
Nevertheless, these models still have limitations: current SOTA models
typically rely on masked reconstruction strategy; however, EEG features of
adjacent channels are highly correlated, which causes the pre-training to
overly focus on low-dimensional signal-similarity features in local regions and
neglect the global discriminative patterns vital for downstream tasks. To
address these limitations, we propose a brain foundation model called CoMET.
Specifically, we employ the masked autoencoder with redesigned patching and
embedding for EEG as backbone and devise a novel contrastive learning framework
with mirror-scale augmentation to strengthen the global discrimination ability.
CoMET is pre-trained on mixed EEG datasets over 3000 subjects with over one
million samples. It is evaluated on ten different downstream datasets, and the
SOTA results demonstrate CoMET's superior ability in extracting universal EEG
representations and strong clinical potential.

### [6] [Gait Analysis using 6DoF Magnetic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00323)
*R. Abhishek Shankar,Hyungjun Ha,Byunghoo Jung*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于6自由度磁地追踪的可穿戴行走分析系统，在人类行为识别任务中达到92%的分类准确率，显著超过传统IMU+磁力计系统的86.69%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴设备虽有便携性优势，但性能不如非可穿戴设备。需要提升可穿戴行走分析系统的性能。

Method: 开发6自由度磁地追踪行走分析系统，采集12名参与者的行走数据，使用CNN和LSTM深度学习分类器识别56种行为（行走、负重行走、慢跑、原地行进），并与IMU+磁力计系统进行性能对比。

Result: 磁地追踪系统达到92%的总体分类准确率，较IMU+磁力计系统的86.69%显著提升。在区分普通行走和负重行走时性能提升8%。

Conclusion: 磁地追踪系统能够提供更完整的6自由度跟踪信息，证明了基于磁地追踪的行走分析方案的可行性。

Abstract: Gait analysis using wearable devices has advantages over non-wearable devices
when it comes to portability and accessibility. However, non-wearable devices
have consistently shown superior performance in terms of the gait information
they can provide. This calls for the need to improve the performance of
wearable device based gait analysis. To that end, we developed a 6
Degrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) magnetic tracking based gait analysis system as a
step in this direction. The system is portable, minimally intrusive, wireless
and power efficient. As a proof-of-concept, the system was used for the task of
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to classify four tasks - walking (W), walking
with weight (WW), jogging (J) and marching on the spot (M). Gait data of 12
participants was collected. The classification performance of two deep learning
(DL) classifiers - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) - was compared. The performance of the magnetic tracking based
gait analysis system was also compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
+ magnetometer based system. The magnetic tracking based system showed an
overall classification accuracy of 92\% compared to 86.69\% for the IMU +
magnetometer system. Moreover, the magnetic tracking system showed an
improvement of about 8\% in being able to differentiate between W and WW. This
highlights the insufficiency in the information content in the data from IMU +
magnetometer, warranting the need for a complete 6DoF tracking. Our work, thus,
proves the feasibility of using magnetic tracking systems for the purpose of
gait analysis.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在混合近场/远场环境下，基于超大规模天线阵列的安全混合波束成形设计，用于同时无线信息和能量传输系统，旨在最大化信息接收器的加权和保密率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G通信技术的发展，超大规模天线阵列和同时无线信息与能量传输技术变得越来越重要。然而，在混合近场/远场环境中，如何设计安全的波束成形方案来同时满足信息传输的安全性和能量收集的需求，是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Result: 仿真结果验证了所提方案的有效性，并提供了关于混合场SWIPT系统安全性能的重要见解，特别是可见性区域和角度用户分离对系统性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为混合近场/远场环境下的安全SWIPT系统提供了有效的波束成形设计方案，揭示了系统参数对安全性能的影响规律，对未来6G通信系统的安全设计具有指导意义。

Abstract: This letter investigates secure hybrid beamforming (HB) design for an
extremely large-scale antenna array-aided simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) system operating in a mixed near-field (NF)/far-field
(FF) environment. A base station (BS) employs HB to transmit information and
artificial noise (AN) signals simultaneously to multiple FF information
receivers (IRs) and NF energy receivers (ERs). The objective is to maximize the
weighted sum secrecy rate for the IRs, considering both Type-I (unable to
cancel AN) and Type-II (capable of canceling AN) IRs, subject to minimum energy
harvesting requirements at the ERs and a BS transmit power constraint. We
formulate optimization problems for both IR types and develop an efficient
iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Simulation
results validate the proposed scheme and provide crucial insights into the
security performance of mixed-field SWIPT systems, highlighting the influence
of visibility regions and angular user separation.

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input
multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical
receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework
leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot
sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design
enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are
suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian
belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing
near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced
computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot
allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to
state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing
capabilities due to its unimodular pilot design.The GaBP-based receiver
achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional
approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor
integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚合物微波光纤的亚太赫兹网络覆盖新范式，通过分布式架构和双频串联操作解决亚太赫兹部署挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚太赫兹频段具有巨大带宽潜力，但物理约束和技术限制使其网络部署面临挑战，需要新的覆盖解决方案

Method: 使用聚合物微波光纤互连低复杂度射频单元，采用菊花链配置的分布式架构，并整合亚10GHz系统提供控制信号和备用方案

Result: 该架构能够减少路径损耗、缓解阻塞问题，实现用户设备与邻近射频单元的连接

Conclusion: 这种串联架构能够充分发挥亚太赫兹技术的潜力，为动态环境提供成本效益高、能效好、高性能的实时连接解决方案

Abstract: The vast bandwidth available at sub-THz frequencies holds great promise for
high-speed wireless access, precise localization, and advanced sensing
applications. However, fundamental physical constraints and technological
limitations make the deployment of reliable sub-THz networks challenging. We
propose a new paradigm for sub-THz coverage by transmitting the RF signals over
polymer microwave fibers (PMFs) that interconnect low-complexity radio units
(RUs) in a daisy-chain configuration. The distributed architecture ensures that
user equipments (UEs) connect to RUs in their proximity, reducing path loss and
mitigating blocking. The RUs leverage low-complexity, compact integrated
antenna modules. Additionally, dual-frequency tandem operation is proposed,
integrating the sub-THz system with a sub-10 GHz system that provides control
signalling and a robust fallback solution for the sub-THz system. This proposed
tandem architecture can open up the full potential of sub-THz technology and
paves the way to cost- and energy-efficient, high-performance, real-time
connectivity in dynamic environments.

*Zahra Rostamikafaki,Francois Chan,Claude D'Amours*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于STAR-RIS的稳健资源分配框架，用于低赨道卫星启动的同时无线信息和能量传输系统，通过处理港道不确定性来最大化收集功率并确保保密速率要求。

Motivation: 解决LEO卫星与地面直接链路被阻塞时的通信问题，利用STAR-RIS来提高系统性能和安全性，应对实际港道状态信息错误的挑战。

Method: 采用S-procedure处理港道不确定性，设计交替优化(AO)框架来聚合优化卫星主动捕获形成和STAR-RIS被动捕获形成，并结合惩罚策略来强制STAR-RIS捕获形成设计。

Result: 模拟结果验证了算法的有效性，显示STAR-RIS构架在总收集功率方面比传统RIS和其他基准方案有显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在存在港道不确定性和密码攻击者的情况下，为LEO卫星SWIPT系统提供稳健的资源分配解决方案，显著提高了系统性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a robust resource allocation framework for a low Earth
orbit (LEO) satellite-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) system, assisted by a ground-deployed simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). We
consider a scenario where direct satellite-to-ground links are obstructed, and
the satellite serves multiple single-antenna energy receivers, information
receivers, and eavesdroppers exclusively via the STAR-RIS. A robust
optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total harvested power,
subject to secrecy rate requirements, transmit power limits, and STAR-RIS
coefficient constraints, under a practical bounded channel state information
(CSI) error model. To achieve optimal robust resource allocation, we address
the challenges posed by coupled optimization variables and bounded channel
estimation errors by first applying the S-procedure to handle robustness
against channel uncertainty. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is
subsequently proposed, where the active beamforming at the LEO satellite and
the passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS are jointly optimized, and a
penalty-based strategy is incorporated to enforce the STAR-RIS beamforming
design. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and demonstrate that the STAR-RIS architecture achieves substantial performance
gains in total harvested power over conventional RIS and other baseline
schemes.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have
emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics,
virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks
face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential
for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without
programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software,
and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external
tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present
PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI
research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses
the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition
to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and
finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive
and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart
for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal
programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless
integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding,
ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array
of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity
indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation
methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for
both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design
process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI
development and thus accelerate their research endeavors. Project Website:

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 基于定位误差下界的风箭定位框架，通过多子载波协同和替代优化算法，在广带毫米波系统中实现了更高精度的动态用户设备定位和跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升广带毫米波系统中动态用户设备的定位和跟踪性能，解决传统方法对路径分辨和三角关系的依赖问题。

Method: 提出PELB驱动的风箭定位框架，基站和用户设备交替传输适应性材料形成信号；开发多子载波协同定位误差下界(MSCPEB)评估系统性能；设计替代优化算法优化混合材料形成器；开发不依赖路径分辨的多路径协同定位方法。

Result: 数值结果验证方法在估计精度上至少提升16%，同时只需约四分之一的时间空资源。MSCPEB不超过各子载波PELB的算术平均值。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多维信息融合和优化材料形成，在广带毫米波系统中实现了高效准确的动态定位，为无线定位技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: To enhance the positioning and tracking performance of dynamic user equipment
(UE) in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, we propose a novel
positioning error lower bound (PELB)-driven ping-pong positioning framework,
where the base station (BS) and UE alternately transmit and receive adaptive
beamforming signals for positioning. All beam-formers are scheduled based on
the locally evaluated PELB. In this framework, we exploit multi-dimensional
information fusion to assist in positioning. Firstly, a multi-subcarrier
collaborative positioning error lower bound (MSCPEB) is proposed to evaluate
the positioning error limits of wideband mmWave systems, which quantifies the
contribution of all subcarriers to positioning accuracy. Moreover, we prove
that the MSCPEB does not exceed the arithmetic mean of the PELBs of the
individual subcarriers. Subsequently, we develop an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm to optimize the hybrid beamformers targeted for MSCPEB
minimization. By convexifying this problem, closed-form solutions of
beamformers are derived. Finally, we develop a multipath collaborative
positioning method that quantifies the impact of path reliability on
positioning accuracy, with a closed-form solution for user position derived.
The proposed method does not rely on path resolution and traditional triangular
relationships. Numerical results validate that the proposed method improves
estimation accuracy by at least 16% compared to potential schemes without
optimized beam configurations, while requiring only approximately one-quarter
of the slot resources.

Abstract: Satellite missions demand ever greater connectivity, especially in the LEO
regime. In this paper, we introduce the new mega-constellation services in
space paradigm: we show that megaconstellations, deployed to offer innovative
services to Earth's users, can provide excellent connectivity to LEO spacecraft
as well. First, we characterise the communication link between space users and
the actual OneWeb and Starlink constellations. A full set of results in terms
of availability, access duration, Doppler, and path losses as a function of
user orbital parameters, identifying optimal user orbits, is provided. The
results achieved by a multi-system user able to communicate with both fleets
are also presented. The potential improvements available if geostationary
constellations are used to complement LEO megaconstellations in a multi-orbit
system are discussed as well. Finally, we focus on two LEO use cases: the
International Space Station and an Earth Observation Sun Synchronous satellite.
All the results demonstrate the numerous advantages of the mega-constellation
connectivity solution, which can transform LEO spacecraft into highly
responsive nodes of a space-to-space network.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效的近场MIMO雷达成像方法，解决了现有方法在计算效率和适用性方面的限制。

Abstract: Near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar imaging suffers from
high computational load inherently due to irregular spatial sampling with
distributed antennas. Existing acceleration methods for near-field MIMO imaging
typically rely on interpolation or compensation of measurements and are
primarily developed for direct reconstruction. This hinders their ease of
adoption for different MIMO geometries and requires further modification for
regularized inversion. In this study, we address these challenges by developing
a fast regularized reconstruction approach for three-dimensional near-field
MIMO imaging based on the Stochastic Proximal Gradient Method. We demonstrate
the performance of the developed approach through experimental measurements.
The results show a significant improvement in runtime without any notable
compromise in reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Optimization-based solvers play a central role in a wide range of signal
processing and communication tasks. However, their applicability in
latency-sensitive systems is limited by the sequential nature of iterative
methods and the high computational cost per iteration. While deep unfolding has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for converting iterative algorithms into learned
models that operate with a fixed number of iterations, it does not inherently
address the cost of each iteration. In this paper, we introduce a learned
optimization framework that jointly tackles iteration count and per-iteration
complexity. Our approach is based on unfolding a fixed number of optimization
steps, replacing selected iterations with low-complexity approximated
computations, and learning extended hyperparameters from data to compensate for
the introduced approximations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on two representative problems: (i) hybrid beamforming; and (ii) robust
principal component analysis. These fundamental case studies show that our
learned approximated optimizers can achieve state-of-the-art performance while
reducing computational complexity by over three orders of magnitude. Our
results highlight the potential of our approach to enable rapid, interpretable,
and efficient decision-making in real-time systems.

Abstract: The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and
advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces
new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted
RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC
capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one
of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with
the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed
scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target:
eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks
launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to
disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the
secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation
(SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit
beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the
legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the
robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The
proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate
metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for
angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.

Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single
flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit
errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process
parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and
constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is
limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are
proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3)
codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is
analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical
complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.

Abstract: Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to
support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device
deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such
as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited
reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in
restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching
antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation
locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging
propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This
paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs
targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical
yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first
derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio
and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a
two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point
using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic
compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple
receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements.
Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional
single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs
and widely spaced user antennas.

Abstract: We address the modeling and optimal beamforming (BF) design for
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems
operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. First, a comprehensive DD
continuous MIMO (DDC MIMO) channel model that incorporates CAPAs at both the
transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) is derived, which is used to obtain explicit
input-output (I/O) relations for various waveforms well suited to integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) and robust to DD channels, namely orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS),
and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Then, functional
optimization problems are formulated for the design of TX and RX BF matrices
that maximize received power, in which novel low-complexity, closed-form
solutions are obtained via the calculus of variations (CoV) method, yielding
expressions closely related to the classical matched filter commonly used in
conventional MIMO systems. Simulation results confirm that the proposed TX/RX
BF designs with CAPAs provide significant performance and computational
complexity gains over conventional MIMO systems in DD channels.

Conclusion: 所提出的局部化训练方法有效解决了Cryo-ET重建中的计算效率问题，为生物样本的高质量3D重建提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) is a powerful tool in structural biology
for 3D visualization of cells and biological systems at resolutions sufficient
to identify individual proteins in situ. The measurements are collected by
tilting the frozen specimen and exposing it to an electron beam of known
dosage. As the biological samples are prone to electron damage, the samples can
be exposed to only a limited dosage of electrons, leading to noisy and
incomplete measurements. Thus, the reconstructions are noisy and incomplete,
leading to the missing wedge problem. Currently, self-supervised learning is
used to compensate for this issue. This typically involves, for each volume to
recover, training a large 3D UNet on the initial noisy reconstruction, leading
to large training time and memory requirements. In this work, we exploit the
local nature of the forward model to train a lightweight network using only
localized data from the measurements. This design provides flexibility in
balancing computational and time requirements while reconstructing the volumes
with high accuracy. We observe experimentally that this network can work well
on unseen datasets, despite using a network trained on a few measurements.

Result: 实验表明该模型成功解耦了宽带多路复用光谱，提升了多光谱光场图像的重建效果

Conclusion: 该方法推进了全光成像技术的发展，为高维数据重建提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Snapshot Multispectral Light-field Imaging (SMLI) is an emerging
computational imaging technique that captures high-dimensional data (x, y, z,
$\theta$, $\phi$, $\lambda$) in a single shot using a low-dimensional sensor.
The accuracy of high-dimensional data reconstruction depends on representing
the spectrum using neural radiance field models, which requires consideration
of broadband spectral decoupling during optimization. Currently, some SMLI
approaches avoid the challenge of model decoupling by either reducing
light-throughput or prolonging imaging time. In this work, we propose a
broadband spectral neural radiance field (BSNeRF) for SMLI systems. Experiments
show that our model successfully decouples a broadband multiplexed spectrum.
Consequently, this approach enhances multispectral light-field image
reconstruction and further advances plenoptic imaging.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cascaded channel estimation for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave multi-user communication
systems. Since the complex channel gains of the cascaded RIS channel are
generally non-Gaussian, the use of the linear minimum mean squared error
(LMMSE) estimator leads to inevitable performance degradation. To tackle this
issue, we propose a variational inference-based framework that approximates the
complex channel gains using a complex adaptive Laplace prior, which effectively
captures their probability distributions in a tractable way. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators
including least squares and LMMSE in terms of cascaded channel estimation
error.

Abstract: Channel extrapolation has attracted wide attention due to its potential to
acquire channel state information (CSI) with high accuracy and minimal
overhead. This is becoming increasingly crucial as the sixth-generation (6G)
mobile networks aim to support complex scenarios, for example, high-mobility
communications utilizing ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technologies and broad spectrum bands, necessitating multi-domain channel
extrapolation. Current research predominantly addresses channel extrapolation
within a single domain, lacking a comprehensive approach to multi-domain
channel extrapolation. To bridge the gap, we propose the concept of
multi-domain channel extrapolation, detailing the essential performance
requirements for 6G networks. These include precise channel extrapolation,
adaptability to varying scenarios, and manageable computational complexity
during both training and inference stages. In light of these requirements, we
elaborate the potential and challenges of incorporating generative artificial
intelligence (GAI)-based models for effective multi-domain channel
extrapolation. Given the ability of the Transformer to capture long-range
dependencies and hidden patterns, we propose a novel Transformer encoder-like
model by eliminating the positional encoding module and replacing the original
multi-head attention with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for multi-domain
channel extrapolation. Simulation results indicate that this model surpasses
existing baseline models in terms of extrapolation accuracy and inference
speed. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the module
design of the proposed design. Finally, we pose several open questions for the
development of practical GAI-based multi-domain channel extrapolation models,
including the issues of explainability, generalization, and dataset collection.

Conclusion: 该方法能够准确预测MNP在不同实验条件下的信号响应，为MPI应用的优化提供了高效的无检定解决方案。

Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a tracer-based medical imaging modality
that enables quantification and spatial mapping of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)
distribution. The magnetization response of MNPs depends on experimental
conditions such as drive field (DF) settings and medium viscosity, as well as
on magnetic parameters of MNPs such as magnetic core diameter, hydrodynamic
diameter, and magnetic anisotropy constant. A comprehensive understanding of
the magnetization response of MNPs can facilitate the optimization of DF and
MNP type for a given MPI application, without the need for extensive
experimentation. In this work, we propose a calibration-free iterative
algorithm using model-based dictionaries for MNP signal prediction at untested
settings. Dictionaries were constructed with the MNP signals simulated using
the coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. Based on the available measurements,
the proposed algorithm jointly estimates the dictionary weights and the
transfer functions due to non-model-based dynamics. These dynamics include the
system response of the measurement setup as well as magnetization dynamics not
accounted for by the employed coupled Brown-N\'eel rotation model. The
algorithm was first validated on synthetic signals at SNR levels of 1 and 10,
and then tested on an in-house MPS setup across six viscosity levels
(0.89-15.33 mPa.s) and DF frequencies of 0.25-2 kHz using two commercial MNPs.
Validation on synthetic signals showed accurate weight and transfer function
estimation even at SNR 1. MPS experiments demonstrated successful prediction of
MNP signals at untested viscosities, with NRMSE below 1.51% and 3.5% for the
two tested MNPs across all DF settings. Predicted signals captured viscosity
dependent trends, and NWD values remained low (<0.10 and <0.07 for the two
tested MNPs), confirming robust weight estimation.

Conclusion: 基于柯西核的CKMMC准则对核带宽不敏感且具有显著厚尾特性，能够有效提升电力系统动态状态估计的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise, outliers, sudden load changes, and bad measurement data
are key factors that diminish the accuracy of dynamic state estimation in power
systems. Additionally, unscented Kalman filters (UKF) based on correntropy
criteria utilize bandwidth-sensitive Gaussian kernels, which may lead to
singular matrices in the Cholesky decomposition. To overcome all the above
problems, in this paper, a robust UKF based on Cauchy kernel maximum mixture
correntropy (CKMMC) criteria over hybrid Beluga Whale-Bat (BWB) optimization
(BWB-CKMMC-UKF) is proposed, in which the kernel is merged of two Cauchy
functions. Specifically, the measurement error and state error are unified in
the cost function by the statistical linearization technique, and the optimal
value of state estimation is obtained by fixed-point iteration. Because of its
insensitive feature to kernel bandwidth and notable thick-tailed feature, the
Cauchy kernel function is utilized instead of the Gaussian kernel in the
optimization criteria. Additionally, to fit the power system model, the shape
coefficients of the kernel in the CKMMC criterion and scale coefficients that
influence the selection of sigma points in the unscented transform are
determined based on the BWB algorithm. Simulation results on IEEE 14, 30, and
57-bus test systems validated the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Cryo-ET allows to generate tomograms of biological samples in situ, capturing
complex structures in their native context. Despite low signal-to-noise ratio
in reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules
makes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned
subtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the
resulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast
and robust procedures to align subtomograms. We propose a subtomogram alignment
framework based on the ball harmonics expansion that combines frequency- and
gradient-based optimization strategies to avoid exhaustive rotation sampling,
enabling a speed-up of an order of magnitude compared to current approaches.

Abstract: High-precision positioning is vital for cellular networks to support
innovative applications such as extended reality, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Existing positioning
algorithms using deep learning techniques require vast amounts of labeled data,
which are difficult to obtain in real-world cellular environments, and these
models often struggle to generalize effectively. To advance cellular
positioning techniques, the 2024 Wireless Communication Algorithm Elite
Competition as conducted, which provided a dataset from a three-sector outdoor
cellular system, incorporating practical challenges such as limited
labeled-dataset, dynamic wireless environments within the target and
unevenly-spaced anchors, Our team developed three innovative positioning
frameworks that swept the top three awards of this competition, namely the
semi-supervised framework with consistency, ensemble learning-based algorithm
and decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm. Specifically, the semi-supervised
framework with consistency effectively generates high-quality pseudo-labels,
enlarging the labeled-dataset for model training. The ensemble learning-based
algorithm amalgamates the positioning coordinates from models trained under
different strategies, effectively combating the dynamic positioning
environments. The decoupled mapping heads-based algorithm utilized sector
rotation scheme to resolve the uneven-spaced anchor issue. Simulation results
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed positioning algorithms
compared to existing benchmarks in terms of the {90%, 80%, 67%, 50%} percentile
and mean distance error.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception refers to a suite of technologies that
empower vehicles to sense their environment and communicate with other
entities, including surrounding vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud/edge
networks. With the growing demands of autonomous driving, V2X perception has
gained significant attention, particularly through the emergence of integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) frameworks. Within this landscape, rigid body
localization (RBL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the estimation
of not only the position and velocity of the targets, but also its
three-dimensional (3D) geometric structure and orientation. This article
introduces the concept of RBL, highlights its unique advantages and
applications, identifies key technical challenges, and finally outlines future
research directions. In addition, the potential of RBL in next-generation -
e.g. beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G) - wireless systems
applied to V2X perception is also discussed, with a focus on its role in
standardization efforts and its relevance across automotive and industrial
domains.

Conclusion: 大规模MIMO超声波阵列系统在理论上能够显著提升定位精度，但实际应用中需要考虑换能器带宽等硬件限制因素。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel ultrasonic array system designed for
high-precision localization using a large-scale MIMO (Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output) architecture. The system combines 32 transmitters with 62
microphones, creating an extended virtual aperture that improves channel
separability and spatial resolution. Each transmitter is excited by a
random-phase multisine within the ultrasonic band, which reduces inter-channel
correlation and increases robustness against multipath. The feasibility of the
approach is demonstrated through simulations of reflector imaging and analysis
of channel separation under realistic transducer bandwidth constraints. Results
show that MIMO processing enables improved separation of reflectors compared to
single-emitter configurations, although practical limitations such as

Abstract: We consider a novel rigid body localization (RBL) method, based only on a set

information, which in the case of RBL is anchor-to-anchor and target-to-target
information. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed

Method: 采用深度展开版本的ISTA和IHT算法，比较使用均方误差的监督学习与使用原始优化问题目标函数的无监督学习。

Conclusion: 损失函数的选择效果依赖于优化问题的凸性质，这为设计高效的深度展开网络提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of loss function selection in deep
unfolding techniques for sparse signal recovery algorithms. Deep unfolding
transforms iterative optimization algorithms into trainable lightweight neural
networks by unfolding their iterations as network layers, with various loss
functions employed for parameter learning depending on application contexts. We
focus on deep unfolded versions of the fundamental iterative shrinkage
thresholding algorithm (ISTA) and the iterative hard thresholding algorithm
(IHT), comparing supervised learning using mean squared error with unsupervised
learning using the objective function of the original optimization problem. Our
simulation results reveal that the effect of the choice of loss function
significantly depends on the convexity of the optimization problem. For convex
$\ell_1$-regularized problems, supervised-ISTA achieves better final recovery
accuracy but fails to minimize the original objective function, whereas we
empirically observe that unsupervised-ISTA converges to a nearly identical
solution as conventional ISTA but with accelerated convergence. Conversely, for
nonconvex $\ell_0$-regularized problems, both supervised-IHT and
unsupervised-IHT converge to better local minima than the original IHT, showing
similar performance regardless of the loss function employed. These findings
provide valuable insights into the design of effective deep unfolded networks
for sparse signal recovery applications.

scenarios. Comparative analyses demonstrate that JS-gOMP outperforms
traditional gOMP, especially in noisy environments, offering a more effective
solution for signal and image processing applications where noise presence is

Conclusion: 该模型揭示了上行链路谱段共享的基本牺牲，为未来6G非地面网络的设计和规制提供了可操作的新见解。

Abstract: The increasing number of satellite deployments, both in the low and
geostationary Earth orbit exacerbates the already ongoing scarcity of wireless
resources when targeting ubiquitous connectivity. For the aim of supporting a
massive number of IoT devices characterized by bursty traffic and modern
variants of random access, we pose the following question: Should competing
satellite operators share spectrum resources or is an exclusive allocation
preferable? This question is addressed by devising a communication model for
two operators which serve overlapping coverage areas with independent IoT
services. Analytical approximations, validated by Monte Carlo simulations,
reveal that spectrum sharing can yield significant throughput gains for both
operators under certain conditions tied to the relative serviced user
populations and coding rates in use. These gains are sensitive also to the
system parameters and may not always render the spectral coexistence mutually
advantageous. Our model captures basic trade-offs in uplink spectrum sharing
and provides novel actionable insights for the design and regulation of future
6G non-terrestrial networks.

Conclusion: 非一致扩散模型能够更好地表征噪声输入中每个元素的可靠性，特别适用于无线信道生成等元素可靠性不均匀的场景

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model,
and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model
that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we
extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error
variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize
the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy
input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is
biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates
exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme.
Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to
capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a
matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression.
Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the
correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme
both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we
propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate
multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical
experiments.

Abstract: The emergence of dense, mission-driven aerial networks supporting the
low-altitude economy presents unique communication challenges, including
extreme channel dynamics and severe cross-tier interference. Traditional
reactive communication paradigms are ill-suited to these environments, as they
fail to leverage the network's inherent predictability. This paper introduces
predictive communication, a novel paradigm transforming network management from
reactive adaptation to proactive optimization. The approach is enabled by
fusing predictable mission trajectories with stable, large-scale radio
environment models (e.g., radio maps). Specifically, we present a hierarchical
framework that decomposes the predictive cross-layer resource allocation
problem into three layers: strategic (routing), tactical (timing), and
operational (power). This structure aligns decision-making timescales with the
accuracy levels and ranges of available predictive information. We demonstrate
that this foresight-driven framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction
in cross-tier interference, laying the groundwork for robust and scalable
low-altitude communication systems.

Abstract: Proximity-based interference is a growing threat to satellite communications,
driven by dense multi-orbit constellations and increasingly agile adversarial

maneuver modeling with RF signal degradation analysis to detect and classify
suspicious proximity operations. Using the open-source Maneuver Detection Data
Generation (MaDDG) library from MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we generate labeled
datasets combining impulsive maneuver profiles with radio-frequency (RF)
impacts across a range of behavioral intents: routine station-keeping, covert
shadowing, and overt jamming. Our approach fuses kinematic features such as
range, velocity, acceleration, and Time of Closest Approach (TCA), with RF
metrics including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), throughput, and
Jammer-to-Signal Ratio (JSR). These features are further enhanced with temporal
derivatives and rolling-window statistics to capture subtle or transient
interference patterns. A Random Forest classifier trained on this fused feature
set achieves 94.67% accuracy and a macro F1 score of 0.9471, outperforming
models using only kinematic or RF inputs. The system is particularly effective
in detecting covert threats, such as surveillance or intermittent jamming, that
evade RF-only methods.

Abstract: Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention,
environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems.
Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be
costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during
floods.In this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme
that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from
existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in
channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length
changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level
variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate
the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of
the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing
environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then
extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between
the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a
beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase
offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the
proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving
a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver
configurations and deployments.

Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing

learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG

classifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model
provided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision,
recall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies

Abstract: This work investigates the covertness and security performance of
Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments.
Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users
with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and
relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates
friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an
eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact
closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under
arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold
for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance.
Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA)
in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security
perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage
probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and
maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA
scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements,
and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate
while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions.
Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while
the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to
maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.

Motivation: 随着GNSS系统脆弱性日益凸显，需要有效的备份导航系统。MF R-Mode作为GNSS中断时的有效备份，但需要校正受地形影响的ASF传播延迟，而传统参考站方法在远离参考站时效果下降

Method: 分析时间性ASF与气象因素之间的相关性，特别关注温度和湿度等气象参数

Result: 温度和湿度与时间性ASF显示出显著相关性，表明这些气象因素在ASF校正中具有潜在应用价值

Conclusion: 基于气象因素预测时间性ASF是可行的，这为提高MF R-Mode定位精度提供了新途径，特别是在远离参考站的区域

Abstract: As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have
become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems
has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an
effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal
strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate
positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor
(ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF,
known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations;
however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the
reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal
ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting
temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature
and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting
their potential utility in ASF correction.

Conclusion: SoM-MIMO系统能够实现高效鲁棒的图像传输，显著提升协同感知任务的性能

Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic
scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical
challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has
demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel
conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works
have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the
discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the
limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP
tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this
paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system
for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural
properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel
properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables
efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results
have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves
average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while
maintaining identical communication overhead.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies
holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity
with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel
modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work
presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at
300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located
transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios.
Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle,
are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized
expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an
image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling
(CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the
measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed
to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector
geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding
channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and
diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection
loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to
characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g.,
structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics,
offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.

TL;DR: ADDM是一种新的正交多载波波形，为OTFS和AFDM提供统一框架，在高速移动场景中性能优于OTFS且与AFDM相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AFDM和OTFS两种波形互不兼容，针对OTFS设计的最先进方法无法直接应用于AFDM，需要开发一个通用框架来统一这两种波形。

Method: 提出Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ADDM)，基于二维变换在Affine-Doppler域调制信息符号，能够享受优异的无模糊多普勒和多普勒分辨率。

Result: 数值结果表明，ADDM在高移动性场景中实现了与AFDM相当的BER性能，但优于OTFS。

Conclusion: ADDM提供了一个通用框架，能够直接应用为OTFS和AFDM设计的最先进方法，同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been regarded as a
candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its
superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency
Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the
above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art
methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This
paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler
Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume
the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information
symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D)
transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution,
which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the
2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic
shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D
cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This
offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed
for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable
BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge
of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations
within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived
from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve
super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN,
employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters
of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational
complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING,
utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system
model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the
sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range
of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC
scenarios.

Conclusion: 流体天线系统通过动态空间适配能够有效应对低空空地通信中的干扰挑战，为安全高效的空中通信提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional
jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional
fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically
balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a
transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer
transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA
serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with
FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack
of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization
problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for
terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation,
etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional
programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the
transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver
sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to
handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined
spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant
performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under
equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably
enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness
across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.

Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered
a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm
shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and
sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these
functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing
significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering
interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development
trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA)
techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple
access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal
role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC
waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality
interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents
mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques
better exploit their interference management capability beyond the
communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve
as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference
management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial
of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental
principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different
ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their
respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the
emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted
ISAC.

Motivation: 现有V2X系统的警告消息缺乏上下文信息，导致可能出现过度谨慎或驾驶效率低下的问题

Method: 在路边单元配备智能摄像头，检测障碍物并传输具有上下文意义的消息，实现"透视"功能显示障碍物后方的行人

Result: 通过实际场地演示和模拟对比，证明该系统显著提高交通效率并减少不必要的减速行为

Conclusion: 语义增强和可解释的V2X系统能够为驾驶员提供更丰富的上下文信息，支持更智能的驾驶决策，提升交通安全性和效率

Abstract: In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units
(RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid
potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a
warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving
behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and
explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with
smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to
vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers
can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation.
Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through"
feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden
pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare
traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results
show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces
unnecessary deceleration.

Motivation: 空天地海一体化网络(SAGSIN)面临两个主要挑战：高速移动平台导致的信道状态信息快速老化，以及协议栈中从太比特光链路到千比特水声链路的极端带宽差异。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了一个跨无线电、光学和声学信道的介质无关适配层，为实验室原型到现场部署指明了道路，并提出了设备上模型压缩、多模态保真度控制等开放研究方向。

Abstract: The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises
seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its
practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and
sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI),
undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the
protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit
acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language
model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces,
can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid
CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack.
Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest
delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating
near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our
LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens.
This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in
a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic
communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation
layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with
promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal
fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation,
charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.

Conclusion: 该方法为高维滤波问题提供了永不退化的解决方案，具有实现简单和计算高效的优点

Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that
inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by
deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update
step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and
its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering
procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized
Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is
differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually
minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles
from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to
implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a
likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as
a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

Conclusion: 提出的构造方法产生了多个具有灵活最小距离的最优(r,δ)-LRCs族，其中许多构造达到了已知的最大码长，为分布式存储系统提供了实用的编码方案。

Abstract: Constructing optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs that attain the Singleton-type bound
is an active and important research direction, particularly due to their
practical applications in distributed storage systems. In this paper, we focus
on the construction of optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with flexible minimum
distances, especially for the case $\delta \geq 3$. We first extend a general
framework -- originally proposed by Li \textit{et al.} (IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory, vol. 65, no. 1, 2019) and Ma and Xing (J. Comb. Theory Ser. A., vol.
193, 2023) -- for constructing optimal $r$-LRCs via automorphism groups of
elliptic function fields to the case of $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. This newly extended
general framework relies on certain conditions concerning the group law of
elliptic curves. By carefully selecting elliptic function fields suitable for
this framework, we arrive at several families of explicit $q$-ary optimal
$(r,3)$-LRCs and $(2,\delta)$-LRCs with lengths slightly less than $q +
2\sqrt{q}$. Next, by employing automorphism groups of hyperelliptic function
fields of genus $2$, we develop a framework for constructing optimal
$(r,3)$-LRCs and obtain a family of explicit $q$-ary optimal $(4,3)$-LRCs with
code lengths slightly below $q+4\sqrt{q}$. We then consider the construction of
optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs via hyperelliptic function fields of arbitrary genus
$g \geq 2$, yielding a class of explicit $q$-ary optimal $(g+1-g',g+1+g')$-LRCs
for $0 \leq g' \leq g-1$ with lengths up to $q + 2g\sqrt{q}$. Finally, applying
certain superelliptic curves derived from modified Norm-Trace curves, we
construct two families of explicit optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with even longer
code lengths and more flexible parameters. Notably, many of the newly
constructed optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs attain the largest known lengths among
existing constructions with flexible minimum distances.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来6G网络提供了更灵活强大的波域控制能力，能够实现近乎在线的自适应配置，且经典SVD解可作为特例恢复

Abstract: We propose a complex-valued neural-network (CV-NN) framework to optimally
configure stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) in next-generation multi-antenna
systems. Unlike conventional solutions that separately tune analog metasurface
phases or rely strictly on SVD-based orthogonal decompositions, our method
models each SIS element as a unit-modulus complex-velued neuron in an
end-to-end differentiable pipeline. This approach avoids enforcing channel
orthogonality and instead allows for richer wavefront designs that can target a
wide range of system objectives, such as maximizing spectral efficiency and
minimizing detection errors, all within a single optimization framework.
Moreover, by exploiting a fully differentiable neural-network formulation and
GPU-based auto-differentiation, our approach can rapidly train SIS
configurations for realistic, high-dimensional channels, enabling near-online
adaptation. Our framework also naturally accommodates hybrid analog-digital
beamforming and recovers classical SVD solutions as a special case. Numerical
evaluations under Rician channels demonstrate that CV-NN SIS optimization
outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in throughput, error performance, and
robustness to channel variation, opening the door to more flexible and powerful
wave-domain control for future 6G networks.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified
as one of the important components of the sixth-generation (6G) non-terrestrial
networks (NTN) to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Due to the low orbit
altitude and high mobility, a massive number of satellites are required to form
a global continuous coverage constellation, leading to a high construction
cost. To this end, this paper proposes a LEO satellite IoT constellation design
algorithm with the goal of minimizing the total cost while satisfying quality
of service (QoS) requirements in terms of coverage ratio and communication
quality. Specifically, with a novel fitness function and efficient algorithm's
operators, the proposed algorithm converges more quickly and achieves lower
constellation construction cost compared to baseline algorithms under the same
QoS requirements. Theoretical analysis proves the global and fast convergence
of the proposed algorithm due to a novel fitness function. Finally, extensive
simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in LEO
satellite IoT constellation design.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which operates at high frequencies,
has gained extensive research interest due to its significantly wide spectrum
and short wavelengths. However, mmWave communication suffers from the notable
drawbacks as follows: i) The mmWave signals are sensitive to the blockage,
which is caused by the weak diffraction ability of mmWave propagation; ii) Even
though the introduction of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can
overcome the performance degradation caused by serve path loss, the location of
users and RISs as well as their densities incur a significant impact on the
coverage and rate performance; iii) When the RISs' density is very high, i.e.,
the network becomes extremely dense, a user sees several line-of-sight RISs and
thus experiences significant interference, which degrades the system
performance. Motivated by the challenges above, we first analyze distributed
multi-RISaided mmWave communication system over Nakagami-m fading from the
stochastic geometry perspective. To be specific, we analyze the end-to-end
(E2E) signal-to-interference-plus-noiseratio (SINR) coverage and rate
performance of the system. To improve the system performance in terms of the
E2E SINR coverage probability and rate, we study the optimization of the
phase-shifting control of the distributed RISs and optimize the E2E SINR
coverage particularly when deploying a large number of reflecting elements in
RISs. To facilitate the study, we optimize the dynamic association criterion
between the RIS and destination. Furthermore, we optimize the multi-RIS-user
association based on the physical distances between the RISs and destination by
exploiting the maximum-ratio transmission.

Abstract: The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently
vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While
traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they
usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale
arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA)
arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling
flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for
secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of
MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising
application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we
examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems,
fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations
between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss
important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA
hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization
to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for
MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.

Motivation: 传统固定位置天线(FPA)系统在近场通信中面临安全挑战，特别是当窃听者与合法用户同方向且更靠近基站时。可移动天线能够通过优化位置来增强物理层安全性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in
near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where
the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential
information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper.
To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to
maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog
beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated
non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization
(AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two
separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid
beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is
first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm.
Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by
approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization
(MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's
position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the
considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing
approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional
far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition,
the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is
located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了时变MIMO衰落信道中联合载波频率偏移(CFO)和信道估计的MAP方法，证明了其等效性，并扩展了低复杂度通用CFO估计算法，分析了时间相关性对估计性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时变MIMO衰落信道中已知时空相关性的联合CFO和信道估计问题，利用先验分布提高估计精度，特别是利用前一个数据包的估计结果。

Method: 采用最大后验概率(MAP)联合估计方法，证明其等效于先进行CFO的MAP估计，再进行信道的最小均方误差(MMSE)估计。扩展了时间不变情况下的通用CFO估计算法到时变情况。

Result: 提出的通用算法无需相位解缠绕即可利用完整的符号相关性，在几乎所有SNR范围内达到贝叶斯克拉美罗下界(BCRLB)。发现BCRLB不是时间相关性的单调函数，且受导频信号结构强烈影响。

Conclusion: 算法能够达到BCRLB，为导频信号设计提供了指导。通过简单的导频信号矩阵中0和1的重排，可以使BCRLB在特定时间相关性范围内从非单调变为单调。

Abstract: We consider time varying MIMO fading channels with known spatial and temporal
correlation and solve the problem of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and
channel estimation with prior distributions. The maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) joint estimation is proved to be equivalent to a separate MAP
estimation of the CFO followed by minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation
of the channel while treating the estimated CFO as true. The MAP solution is
useful to take advantage of the estimates from the previous data packet. A low
complexity universal CFO estimation algorithm is extended from the time
invariant case to the time varying case. Unlike past algorithms, the universal
algorithm does not need phase unwrapping to take advantage of the full range of
symbol correlation and achieves the derived Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(BCRLB) in almost all SNR range. We provide insight on the the relation among
the temporal correlation coefficient of the fading, the CFO estimation
performance, and the pilot signal structure. An unexpected observation is that
the BCRLB is not a monotone function of the temporal correlation and is
strongly influenced by the pilot signal structures. A simple rearrangement of
the 0's and 1's in the pilot signal matrix will render the BCRLB from being
non-monotone to being monotone in certain temporal correlation ranges. Since
the BCRLB is shown to be achieved by the proposed algorithm, it provides a
guideline for pilot signal design.

Conclusion: DSK技术在高频移动环境中具有优异的鲁棒性和可扩展性，能够显著延长相干时间并天然抵抗相位噪声，为下一代无线通信系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid variation of the wireless channel (short channel coherence time)
and the phase noise are two prominent concerns in Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and
sub-Terahertz systems communication systems. Equalizing the channel effect and
tracking the phase noise necessitate dense pilot insertion. Direction-Shift
Keying (DSK), a recent variant of Spatial Modulation (SM), addresses these
challenges by encoding information in the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) using a
distributed antenna system (DAS), rather than relying on amplitude or phase.
DSK has been shown to extend coherence time by up to four orders of magnitude.
Despite its promise, existing DSK studies are largely simulation-based and
limited to simplified roadside unit scenarios and mobile device (MD) equipped
with only two antennas. DSK's performance in general settings, along with the
fundamental laws governing its behavior, such as coherence time and resilience
to phase noise, remain open problems. In this paper, we derive the structure of
the optimal detector for the case of $M$-antenna MD. Then, we establish the
governing law for DSK's coherence time, termed the Direction Coherence Time
(DCT), defining the the temporal duration over which the DoA remains
approximately invariant. We analytically establish that DCT scales with $d/v$
(transmitter-receiver distance over velocity), while the Channel Coherence Time
(CCT) scales with $\lambda/v$, revealing a coherence time gain on the order of
$d/\lambda$ (equivalent to more than four orders of magnitude.) Furthermore, we
prove that DSK inherently cancels the phase noise, requiring no additional
compensation. Analytical predictions are validated through simulations,
confirming the robustness and scalability of DSK in high-frequency mobile
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ReRAM等存储技术的发展，信息数据被视为二维而非一维，需要引入新的二维约束来提高系统可靠性。现有研究主要关注一维约束，二维约束的研究相对较少，特别是如何从满足约束的一维编码构造高效的二维编码是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一个通用框架来设计二维有界权重约束编码。该方法基于存在容量逼近的一维编码设计，通过系统性的构造方法确保二维编码中每行每列的权重（1的数量）不超过给定的函数f(n)限制。

Result: 研究表明，如果存在容量逼近的一维编码设计，那么该方法可以为所有f(n)=ω(log n)的情况提供容量逼近的二维编码。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决二进制有界权重约束的二维编码问题提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在f(n)=ω(log n)时能够实现容量逼近的性能，为二维存储约束编码的设计提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Recent developments in storage- especially in the area of resistive random
access memory (ReRAM)- are attempting to scale the storage density by regarding
the information data as two-dimensional (2D), instead of one-dimensional (1D).
Correspondingly, new types of 2D constraints are introduced into the input
information data to improve the system reliability. While 1D constraints have
been extensively investigated in the literature, the study for 2D constraints
is much less profound. Particularly, given a constraint $\mathcal{F}$ and a
design of 1D codes whose codewords satisfy $\mathcal{F}$, the problem of
constructing efficient 2D codes, such that every row and every column in every
codeword satisfy $\mathcal{F}$, has been a challenge. This work provides an
efficient solution to the challenging coding problem above for the binary
bounded-weight constrained codes that restrict the maximum number of $1$'s
(called {\em weight}). Formally, we propose a universal framework to design 2D
codes that guarantee the weight of every row and every column of length $n$ to
be at most $f(n)$ for any given function $f(n)$. We show that if there exists a
design of capacity-approaching 1D codes, then our method also provides
capacity-approaching 2D codes for all $f=\omega(\log n)$.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures, which include multiple levels, are prevalent in
statistical and machine-learning models as well as physical systems. Extending
the foundational result that the maximum entropy distribution under mean
constraints is given by the exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann form, we introduce the
framework of "hierarchical maximum entropy" to address these multilevel models.
We demonstrate that Pareto optimal distributions, which maximize entropies
across all levels of hierarchical transformations, can be obtained via
renormalization-group procedures from theoretical physics. This is achieved by
formulating multilevel extensions of the Gibbs variational principle and the
Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of entropy. Moreover, we explore
settings with hierarchical invariances that significantly simplify the
renormalization-group procedures, enhancing computational efficiency: quadratic
modular loss functions, logarithmic loss functions, and nearest-neighbor loss
functions. This is accomplished through the introduction of the concept of
parameter flows, which serves as an analog to renormalization flows in
renormalization group theory. This work connects ideas from probability theory,
information theory, and statistical mechanics.

Motivation: 信息理论表明自适应方法可以将查询次数减少一半，但此前没有算法能够超越非自适应边界，自适应方法的实际效益一直是个开放性问题。

Method: 将QGT问题降维到稀疏度相关的整数向量恢复任务，然后将其建模为离线强化学习问题，使用决策变换器进行自适应求解。

Result: 实验表明，该自适应算法首次将平均查询次数降低到非自适应信息理论下界以下，证明了自适应性的有效性。

Conclusion: 自适应方法确实能够减少QGT问题所需的查询次数，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal
is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each
query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries.
Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a
twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has
surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open
question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector
recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem
rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task
as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers
to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective
end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for
the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average
number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic
bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.

Abstract: Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) can dramatically reduce the queuing
delay of block codes in real-time services. In this paper, we aim to explore
the fundamental limit of large-field-size RLSCs in stochastic symbol erasure
channels (SEC). The Non-systematic RLSCs (NRLSCs) in i.i.d. SEC has been
analyzed in [Pinwen Su et al. 2022]. In this work, we first derive the
closed-form expression on the exact error probability of NRLSCs in
Gilbert-Elliott symbol erasure channels (G-ESEC). Compared to i.i.d SEC, the
erasure probability of G-ESEC depends on channel state, thus transitions
between the states should be considered. To deal with the stochastic state
transitions, we introduce two novel techniques. (i) To account for the impact
of switching states on probability terms, we find and leverage the recursive
structure of the state transition traces. (ii) To obtain the expected number of
error timeslots, we derive the stationary initial distribution of the states,
and formulate iterative equation to characterize the expectation terms. Then we
analyze the Systematic RLSCs (SRLSCs) in a special SEC, i.e., the packet
erasure channel (PEC). In this scenario, SRLSCs could save some source symbols
which should have exceeded the decoding delay in NRLSCs, and thus could
significantly reduce the error probability. To this point, our contributions
are two-folds. (i) Through a case study, we find a counter-intuitive phenomenon
that SRLSCs can cause unexpected error events comparing to NRLSCs in some
erasure patterns. Then we fully characterize the error event of SRLSCs for any
erasure pattern. (ii) For i.i.d. PEC, we derive an analytical expression on
exact error probability of SRLSCs when length of memory approaches infinity and
coding rate equals to 1/2. Simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of
our analysis and compare the performance of NRLSCs, SRLSCs, and existing
streaming codes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have attracted increasing
attention in the wireless communication domain. Leveraging the powerful
multi-task learning capability, FMs hold the promise of unifying multiple tasks
of wireless communication with a single framework. with a single framework.
Nevertheless, existing wireless FMs face limitations in the uniformity to
address multiple tasks with diverse inputs/outputs across different
communication scenarios.In this paper, we propose a MUlti-taSk
Environment-aware FM (MUSE-FM) with a unified architecture to handle multiple
tasks in wireless communications, while effectively incorporating scenario

prompt-guided data encoder-decoder pair to handle data with heterogeneous

Abstract: Aligning with the global mandates pushing towards advanced technologies with
reduced resource consumption and environmental impacts, the sustainability of
wireless networks becomes a significant concern in 6G systems. To address this
concern, a native integration of sustainability into the operations of
next-generation networks through novel designs and metrics is necessary.
Nevertheless, existing wireless sustainability efforts remain limited to
energy-efficient network designs which fail to capture the environmental impact
of such systems. In this paper, a novel sustainability metric is proposed that
captures emissions per bit, providing a rigorous measure of the environmental
foot- print associated with energy consumption in 6G networks. This metric also
captures how energy, computing, and communication resource parameters influence
the reduction of emissions per bit. Then, the problem of allocating the energy,
computing and communication resources is posed as a multi-objective (MO)
optimization problem. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, our framework
leverages MO reinforcement learning (MORL) to maximize the novel sustainability
metric alongside minimizing energy consumption and average delays in
successfully delivering the data, all while adhering to constraints on energy
resource capacity. The proposed MORL methodology computes a global policy that
achieves a Pareto-optimal tradeoff among multiple objectives, thereby balancing
environmental sustainability with network performance. Simulation results show
that the proposed approach reduces the average emissions per bit by around 26%
compared to state-of-the-art methods that do not explicitly integrate carbon
emissions into their control objectives.

serial protocol based on one-by-one antenna activation and a parallel protocol
utilizing a binary S-Matrix activation. The serial protocol is characterized by
its superior numerical stability but a lack of array gain, whereas the parallel
protocol theoretically offers array gain but suffers from severe performance
degradation due to structural crosstalk from the non-orthogonal S-Matrix and
ill-conditioning from cumulative leakage. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the
fundamental commonalities and asymmetries between uplink and downlink channel
estimation in pinching-antenna systems. Numerical results demonstrate that 1)
in an ideal lossless model, the parallel protocol is superior to the serial
protocol due to the array gain from simultaneous energy collection in uplink
transmission; 2) in a practical model with physical losses, the serial protocol
outperforms the parallel protocol, as the performance of the parallel protocol
is degraded by the numerical instability from cumulative leakage, which
outweighs the benefit of array gain; 3) For downlink channel estimation, the
serial protocol is more suitable because it avoids bidirectional power
splitting, while the parallel protocol is more suitable for the uplink as it
can make full use of array gain.

Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless communication enables massive edge device access
and supports real-time intelligent services such as the Internet of things
(IoT) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X). However, the surge in edge devices

address the challenge, feasibility guaranteed learning-to-optimize (L2O)
techniques have recently gained attention. These learning-based methods offer
efficient alternatives to conventional solvers by directly learning mappings
from system parameters to feasible and near-optimal solutions. This article

techniques and investigates the application of constrained L2O in wireless RA
systems and. The paper also presents a case study to benchmark different L2O
approaches in weighted sum rate problem, and concludes by identifying key

Abstract: Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the most promising techniques
for future wireless cellular communication systems. This paper considers coded
caching in a partially cooperative wireless D2D network, where only a subset of
users transmit during delivery, while all users request files. The
non-transmitting users are referred to as selfish users. All existing schemes
that do not require knowledge of the identity of selfish users before content
placement are limited to the high-memory regime, particularly when the number
of selfish users is large. We propose a novel coded caching scheme for a
partially cooperative D2D network that operates in all feasible memory regimes,
regardless of the number of selfish users. We also derive a lower bound on the
transmission load of a partially cooperative D2D coded caching scheme. Using
this bound, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the high-memory
regime.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于计算机视觉和机器学习的新题方法，通过分析硅化钾溶液的颜色变化来准确测量非热等离子水液中的总氧剂浓度，充分解决了传统滴定法的主观性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非热等离子水液中总氧剂浓度的准确测量遇到挑战，因为反应性氧和氮种类存在时间短暂，而传统滴定法存在主观性问题。需要一种更准确、可靠的测量方法。

Method: 研究开发了一种颜色基于计算机分析方法：1）使用自建视觉数据采集系统拍摄硅化钾溶液氧化过程中的颜色变化；2）通过图像处理流程提取RGB、HSV和Lab颜色特征；3）使用5种机器学习模型进行训练和预测。

Result: 提取的颜色特征与测量的总氧剂浓度呈现强线性相关性，特别是HSV中的饱和度、Lab中的a和b频道以及RGB中的蓝色频道。线性回归和梯度提升模型达到最高预测准确度（R² > 0.990）。将特征集从9个减少到4个后仍能保持相似性能。

Conclusion: 该颜色基于计算机分析系统能够高准确地预测硅化钾溶液中的总氧剂浓度（R² > 0.998），即使在特征数量减少的情况下也能继续保持高准确性，为非热等离子水液氧剂浓度测量提供了一种可靠、高效的新方法。

Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in
non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge
due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the
subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot}
determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis
(CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning
(ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during
oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured
high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during
oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments
was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames
were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV,
and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated,
and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured
[Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and
blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the
extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among
them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest
predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature
set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved
prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of
the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA
system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy
(R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at

statistics to 2D cepstral representations, a novel approach in image analysis.
Combined with established handcrafted lesion descriptors, these features were
evaluated using XGBoost models. Incorporating select cepstral features improved
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and F1

cepstral GLCM features offer complementary discriminatory information for

Conclusion: 量子增强Transformer在计算神经科学中具有巨大潜力，能更高效建模复杂时空动力学并提高临床可解释性

Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a
pivotal tool for revealing intrinsic brain network connectivity and identifying
neural biomarkers of neuropsychiatric conditions. However, classical
self-attention transformer models--despite their formidable representational
power--struggle with quadratic complexity, large parameter counts, and
substantial data requirements. To address these barriers, we introduce a
Quantum Time-series Transformer, a novel quantum-enhanced transformer
architecture leveraging Linear Combination of Unitaries and Quantum Singular
Value Transformation. Unlike classical transformers, Quantum Time-series
Transformer operates with polylogarithmic computational complexity, markedly
reducing training overhead and enabling robust performance even with fewer
parameters and limited sample sizes. Empirical evaluation on the largest-scale
fMRI datasets from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and the UK
Biobank demonstrates that Quantum Time-series Transformer achieves comparable
or superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art classical
transformer models, with especially pronounced gains in small-sample scenarios.
Interpretability analyses using SHapley Additive exPlanations further reveal
that Quantum Time-series Transformer reliably identifies clinically meaningful
neural biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These
findings underscore the promise of quantum-enhanced transformers in advancing
computational neuroscience by more efficiently modeling complex spatio-temporal
dynamics and improving clinical interpretability.

Method: 通过对比研究，分析Gemini 2.5 Pro模型在恨病变、视网膜血管、乳腺肿分割任务上的零样本性能，并按难易程度分析极端案例

Result: 在恨病变和乳腺肿分割中，专业模型在简单案例上更好，但全能模型在复杂案例中更稳定；在细粒度高的视网膜血管分割中，专业模型仍优势

Conclusion: 当前全能模型还无法完全替代专业模型，但具有补充作用，特别是在处理具有挑战性的极端案例时提高稳健性

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study
analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5
Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

Motivation: 现有乳腺癌风险预测模型性能有限且未整合数字乳腺断层合成(DBT)成像技术，需要开发更准确的早期检测方法

Method: 使用Meta AI DINOv2图像编码器提取特征，结合累积风险层，基于161,753次DBT检查数据训练5年风险预测模型

Result: 在测试集上，最佳模型在5年预测期内实现了0.80的AUROC

Conclusion: DBT为基础的深度学习方法具有巨大潜力，可作为传统风险评估工具的有力补充，为未来验证和增强研究提供良好基础

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide,
necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR
detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack
interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three
innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances
retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility
of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2)
Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings
with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and
domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3)
Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down
the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable
predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The
proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a
recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an
MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly
clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world
diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and
uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness
of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse
conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets.
These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical
adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited
settings.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is a critical tool in medical diagnostics, offering
real-time visualization of physiological processes. One of its major advantages
is its ability to capture temporal dynamics, which is essential for assessing
motion patterns in applications such as cardiac monitoring, fetal development,
and vascular imaging. Despite its importance, current deep learning models
often overlook the temporal continuity of ultrasound sequences, analyzing
frames independently and missing key temporal dependencies. To address this
gap, we propose a method for learning effective temporal representations from
ultrasound videos, with a focus on echocardiography-based ejection fraction
(EF) estimation. EF prediction serves as an ideal case study to demonstrate the
necessity of temporal learning, as it requires capturing the rhythmic
contraction and relaxation of the heart. Our approach leverages temporally
consistent masking and contrastive learning to enforce temporal coherence
across video frames, enhancing the model's ability to represent motion
patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our method achieves a
substantial improvement in EF prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance
of temporally-aware representation learning for real-time ultrasound analysis.

resolution of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The reconstruction process
consists of two phases: first, the measured data is processed using the
generalized inverse of the measurement matrix for quick image recovery. Then,
the spatial sparsity of the scene is leveraged to enhance reconstruction in
dense areas, using either an iterative method or a neural network-based
approach. With a compression ratio of 0.41% and an image acquisition rate of
6.8 Hz at 22 kHz DMD operation, this framework supports real-time,
high-resolution dynamic imaging with the reconstruction that matches the
acquisition rate on a mid-tier desktop GPU.

Motivation: 传统的飞扫描方法不能根据样品特征自适应地调整扫描路径，在均匀无趣区域浪费时间。而现有的深度学习方法需要大量训练数据和高计算成本，且依赖初始采样质量。

Method: 提出一种多迭代飞扫描框架：每迭代使用评分函数生成初始锚点和识别潜在关键区域，通过目标函数优化锚点集合，计算最短扫描路径进行飞扫描，然后利用图像补全技术恢复整体图像为下一次扫描做准备。

Result: 该方法能够进一步缩短扫描过程，潜在降低X射暴露微量，同时保持关键区域的高质量和详细信息。

Conclusion: 这种自适应性多迭代飞扫描框架为X射显微镜提供了更高效的扫描方案，在缩短扫描时间的同时确保了关键区域的图像质量。

Abstract: In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to
acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning
the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time
and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally
important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics
of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting
regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for
raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter
optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by
reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this
approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a
large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose
leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on
regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct
details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning
process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining
high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we
introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned
image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a
score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs,
and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to
an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning
path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently
apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the
next scan iteration.

Abstract: Lesion Segmentation in PET/CT scans is an essential part of modern
oncological workflows. To address the challenges of time-intensive manual
annotation and high inter-observer variability, the autoPET challenge series
seeks to advance automated segmentation methods in complex multi-tracer and
multi-center settings. Building on this foundation, autoPET IV introduces a
human-in-the-loop scenario to efficiently utilize interactive human guidance in
segmentation tasks. In this work, we incorporated tracer classification, organ
supervision and simulated clicks guidance into the nnUNet Residual Encoder
framework, forming an integrated pipeline that demonstrates robust performance
in a fully automated (zero-guidance) context and efficiently leverages
iterative interactions to progressively enhance segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Hyperspectral (HS) images provide fine spectral resolution but have limited
spatial resolution, whereas multispectral (MS) images capture finer spatial
details but have fewer bands. HS-MS fusion aims to integrate HS and MS images
to generate a single image with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This
is commonly formulated as an inverse problem with a linear forward model.
However, reconstructing high-quality images using the forward model alone is
challenging, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. Over the
years, numerous methods have been developed, including wavelets, total
variation, low-rank models, and deep neural networks. In this work, we
investigate the paradigm of denoiser-driven regularization, where a powerful
off-the-shelf denoiser is used for implicit regularization within an iterative
algorithm. This approach has shown promise but remains relatively underexplored
in hyperspectral imaging. Our focus is on a crucial aspect of denoiser-driven
algorithms: ensuring convergence of the iterations. It is known that powerful
denoisers can produce high-quality reconstructions, but they are also prone to
instability and can cause the iterations to diverge. The challenge is to design
denoisers that come with a convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose a
denoiser-driven fusion algorithm, HyDeFuse, which leverages a class of
pseudo-linear denoisers for implicit regularization. We demonstrate how the
contraction mapping theorem can be applied to establish global linear
convergence of HyDeFuse. Additionally, we introduce enhancements to the
denoiser that significantly improve the performance of HyDeFuse, making it
competitive with state-of-the-art techniques. We validate our theoretical
results and present fusion results on publicly available datasets to
demonstrate the performance of HyDeFuse.
