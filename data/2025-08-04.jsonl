It is important for tasks such as\nspectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent\nyears, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However,\nmainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use\ntime-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key\nmodulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication\nconditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a\nlarge amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments.\nTo solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called\nRIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from\nunlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking\nand reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as\namplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable\nrepresentations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it\nperforms better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks.\nNotably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets\nwith only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization\nability and potential for real-world deployment."}

The active IRS has the capability of\namplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path\nloss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix.\nAccordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the\nreflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject\nto the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs,\nthe transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power\namplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem\nis highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this\nchallenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the\nsensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for\nwhich the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose\ntwo efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain\nhigh-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the\ninherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification\nscaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the\nsignal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings.\nFinally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC\ncompared to its passive IRSs counterparts."}

However, these receivers detect\nonly signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference\nsignals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery,\nexisting modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly\nwith this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough\nLO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA\nreceivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM\nmaximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points,\nensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive\nco-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of\nreference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM\ngenerates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals,\nit adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the\nthreshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the\ntransformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB\nover conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation\n(QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)."}

To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques\nare commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite\ngrowing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on\nprotocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the\nfundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal\nbounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,\nwhere no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the\nproblem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic\nperspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,\neach holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who\naim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires\nthat no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up\nto $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies\nthe minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In\nparticular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input\nsum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at\nleast one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no\nfewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols.
