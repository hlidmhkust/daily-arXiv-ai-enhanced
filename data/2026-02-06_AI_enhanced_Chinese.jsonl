Infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks are long-term complications that make early detection essential. In this paper, we design a powerful framework based on transfer learning utilizing DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images. The model was trained on an online dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images of cyst-infected and non-infected patients. Each ultrasound frame was resized to 224x224 pixels and encoded with precise pathological indicators. The MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies were used to improve generalization, yielding a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% by Densenet201 and a validation loss of 0.617 with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4, respectively. We evaluated the model's interpretability using leading Explainable AI (XAI) approaches such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME, reasoning with and presenting explicit visual reasons for the model's behaviors, therefore increasing the model's transparency. This study proposes an automated system for medical picture diagnosis that may be used effectively and confidently in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eDenseNet201\u548cResNet50\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5375\u5de2\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u56ca\u5375\u5de2\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8699.80%\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u56ca\u5375\u5de2\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u662f\u80b2\u9f84\u5987\u5973\u5e38\u89c1\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5b55\u3001\u4ee3\u8c22\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u548c\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u957f\u671f\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DenseNet201\u548cResNet50\u6784\u5efa\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57283856\u5f20\u5375\u5de2\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u91c7\u7528MixUp\u548cCutMix\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e3a224x224\u50cf\u7d20\u3002\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u3001Grad-CAM\u548cLIME\u7b49\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "DenseNet201\u8fbe\u523099.80%\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4e3a0.617\uff08alpha\u503c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.25\u548c0.4\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a series of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. An artificial intelligence (deep learning) model was used to characterize treatment-induced changes by predicting the temporal order of paired images. The model was first trained with the images from the first and the last fractions (F1-FL), then with all pairs (All-pairs). Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), compared to a radiologist's performance, and qualitative analyses - the saliency map evaluation to investigate affected anatomical regions. Input ablation experiments were performed to identify the anatomical regions altered by radiotherapy. The radiologist conducted an additional task on partial images reconstructed by saliency map regions, reporting observations as well. Quantitative image analysis was conducted to investigate the results from the model and the radiologist. Results: The F1-FL model yielded near-perfect performance (AUC of 0.99), significantly outperforming the radiologist. The All-pairs model yielded an AUC of 0.97. This performance reflects therapy-induced changes, supported by the performance correlation to fraction intervals, ablation tests and expert's interpretation. Primary regions driving the predictions were prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Conclusion: The model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over one or a few days, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations confirmed by experts. This underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528AI\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790MR-Linac\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u653e\u7597\u671f\u95f4\uff08\u5e73\u57472\u5929\u95f4\u9694\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u6cbb\u7597\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5e38\u89c4\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7eb5\u5411MR-Linac\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u653e\u7597\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\uff08\u5e73\u57472\u5929\uff09\u5185\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6027\u7814\u7a76761\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u76840.35T MR-Linac\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u6cbb\u7597\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u7528\u9996\u672b\u5206\u6b21\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u6240\u6709\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4e0e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "F1-FL\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08AUC 0.99\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\uff1bAll-pairs\u6a21\u578bAUC\u4e3a0.97\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u533a\u57df\u4e3a\u524d\u5217\u817a\u3001\u8180\u80f1\u548c\u803b\u9aa8\u8054\u5408\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u653e\u7597\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4bMR-Linac\u5206\u6b21\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u57281-\u51e0\u5929\u5185\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u653e\u7597\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u524d\u5217\u817a\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u5668\u5b98\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86MR-Linac\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that a deep learning model with a similar approach to TractSeg will improve similarity between an algorithm-generated mask and an expert-labeled ground truth. Given a cohort of 56 manually labelled white matter bundles, we take inspiration from TractSeg's 2D UNet architecture, and we modify inputs to match bundle definitions as determined by pediatric experts, evaluation to use k fold cross validation, the loss function to masked Dice loss. We evaluate Dice score, volume overlap, and volume overreach of 16 major regions of interest compared to the expert labeled dataset. To test whether our approach offers statistically significant improvements over TractSeg, we compare Dice voxels, volume overlap, and adjacency voxels with a Wilcoxon signed rank test followed by false discovery rate correction. We find statistical significance across all bundles for all metrics with one exception in volume overlap. After we run TractSeg and our model, we combine their output masks into a 60 label atlas to evaluate if TractSeg and our model combined can generate a robust, individualized atlas, and observe smoothed, continuous masks in cases that TractSeg did not produce an anatomically plausible output.

Generative models, especially diffusion models, offer a new paradigm for video compression by leveraging high-level semantic understanding and powerful visual synthesis. This paper propose a video compression framework that integrates generative priors to drastically reduce bit-rate while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Specifically, our method compresses high-level semantic representations of the video, then uses a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct frames from these semantics. To further improve compression, we characterize motion information with global camera trajectories and foreground segmentation: background motion is compactly represented by camera pose parameters while foreground dynamics by sparse segmentation masks. This allows for significantly boosts compression efficiency, enabling descent video reconstruction at extremely low bit-rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u9891", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u65f6\u7a7a\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1. \u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u5efa\u5e27\uff1b3. \u7528\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u524d\u666f\u5206\u5272\u8868\u5f81\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\u80cc\u666f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u524d\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6781\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\\log n$ for a constant $C\\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u6d4b\u5e8f\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u8fd0\u884c\u957f\u5ea6\u9608\u503ck\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5e38\u6570\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "DNA\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u6d4b\u5e8f\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u5220\u9664\u72ec\u7acb\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5355\u5220\u9664\u8ddf\u968f\u957f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11k\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6e38\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5206\u4e24\u79cdk\u503c\u60c5\u51b5\uff1a1) k=C log n\uff08\u5e38\u6570C\u2208(0,1)\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u7ea0\u6b63t\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5220\u9664\u7684\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u5c0f\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\uff1b2) k\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6781\u7aef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u957f\u5ea6\u2265k\u7684\u6e38\u7a0b\u540e\u90fd\u53d1\u751f\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8ek=C log n\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u4f4e\u9636\u9879\uff09\u5728(1-C)t log n\u548c2(1-C)t log n\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u662f\u4efb\u610ft-\u5220\u9664\u7ea0\u6b63\u7801\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u7684(1-C)\u500d\u3002\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u7801\uff0c\u5f53t=1\u4e14C>1/2\u65f6\uff0c\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u57fa\u672c\u5339\u914d\u975e\u6784\u9020\u6027\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e38\u6570k\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5e38\u6570k\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u8fbe\u901f\u7387\u7684\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u6d4b\u5e8f\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u72ec\u7acb\u5220\u9664\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aDNA\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u548c\u6784\u9020\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Mehedi Hassan", "Taufiq Hasan"], "title": "Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensembling for Interpretable Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening via Active Query and Vascular Attention", "comment": "16 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is among the major causes of preventable childhood blindness. Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search.

A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3001\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u9760\u901a\u4fe1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3) \u63a8\u5bfc\u7ed9\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c06\u975e\u51f8\u7ea6\u675f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0ISCC\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the \"domain gap\" and \"feature absence\" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\\times$ faster measurement, a 98\\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\u4e0eLR-SAGE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b050\u500d\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u300198%\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u548c99.96%\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3a6G AI-native\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ISAC\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b06G\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u907f\u514d\u65f6\u5ef6\u6a21\u7cca\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9891\u70b9\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u9891\u7387\u91c7\u6837(PFS)\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u9891\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f3c\u7136\u4fee\u6b63\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u5e7f\u4e49\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316(LR-SAGE)\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u6548\u5e94\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u5931\u771f", "result": "\u5728280-300GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b050\u500d\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\u300198%\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u300199.96%\u540e\u5904\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8be6\u5c3d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efaAI-native 6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ISAC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u4f7f\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398AI\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b"}}

However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios.

Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch. Detecting discs with moderate severity can still be challenging, but focusing on disc-level features provides a practical way to assess the lumbar spinal stenosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8170\u690e\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u75c7\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u77e2\u72b6\u4f4dT2\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b078.1%\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8170\u690e\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u75c7\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u8bfb\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u4e2a\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u89e3\u5256\u5b9a\u4f4d\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u5916\u89c2\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8fbe\u523078.1%\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7387\u964d\u81f32.13%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6539\u5584\u3002\u867d\u7136\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7126\u4e3a\u8170\u690e\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8170\u690e\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e2d\u5ea6\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)}$.\n  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius.

In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5206\u5272\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eCF-MIMO\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u548cAP\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4", "motivation": "\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65e0\u5c0f\u533aMIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u5206\u5272\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fAP\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUCSFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u5272\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0cAP\u4fa7DPU\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u7ea7\u805a\u5408\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0AP\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0cUCSFL\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eVGG16\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u5272\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u7b56\u7565\uff0cMNIST\u624b\u5199\u6570\u5b57\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fVGG16\u6536\u655b", "conclusion": "UCSFL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316CF-MIMO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5272\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6"}}

To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u573a\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u8fdc\u573a\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u89c6\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u9891\u7387\u6ee4\u6ce2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5929\u7ebf\u57df\u6743\u91cd\u6574\u5f62\u5b9e\u73b0\u89d2\u5ea6\u8986\u76d6\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u6eda\u964d\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b3) \u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd1\u573a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u6cf0\u52d2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5c062D\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a2D\u9006\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FT-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u6563\u7126\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8986\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdc\u573a\u548c\u8fd1\u573a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u6307\u7eb9\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684iRRT*\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ba4\u5916\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u6307\u7eb9\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u5ba4\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u8d4b\u5f62\u6307\u7eb9\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u65e0\u7ebf\u8bbe\u5907\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Informed RRT* (iRRT*)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u786e\u5b9a\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1aTransformer\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5916\u7684\u65b0\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684iRRT*\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u4f9b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f7f\u752828GHz\u5ba4\u5916\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2MIMO\u5ba4\u5916\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5bfc\u822a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth.

While radio maps enable proactive mode selection, reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging. Existing physics-agnostic or data-driven methods often fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity. We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Simulations show that PR-LRTC achieves a 4 dB gain over baselines at a 10% sampling ratio. It effectively preserves sharp shadowing edges, providing a robust, physics-compliant solution for low-overhead beam management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPR-LRTC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u50cf\u7d20\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u50cf\u7d20\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e09\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4f4e\u79e9\u6027\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5929\u7ebf\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7a7a\u4e2d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5dee\u5206\u589e\u76ca\u62d3\u6251\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ADMM\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u572810%\u91c7\u6837\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cPR-LRTC\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f974dB\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u9510\u5229\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6ce2\u675f\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5408\u89c4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "PR-LRTC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6ce2\u675f\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we consider the multiple base-station (BS) collaborative sensing problem in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) mmWave communication system. Our aim is to sense a remote target shape with the collected signals which consist of both the reflection and scattering signals. We first characterize the mmWave's scattering and reflection effects based on the Lambertian scattering model. Then we apply the periodogram technique to obtain rough scattering point detection, and further incorporate the subspace method to achieve more precise scattering and reflection point detection. Based on these, a reconstruction algorithm based on Hough Transform and principal component analysis (PCA) is designed for a single convex polygon target scenario. To improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction results, we propose a method to further fuse the scattering and reflection points. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6", "motivation": "\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9MIMO-OFDM\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5305\u542b\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8eLambertian\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u5468\u671f\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7565\u6563\u5c04\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b3. \u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8eHough\u53d8\u6362\u548cPCA\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5355\u4e2a\u51f8\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u76ee\u6807\uff1b5. \u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u57fa\u7ad9\u534f\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5f62\u72b6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6"}}

Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(OT)\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u58f0\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u58f0\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u975e\u51f8\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(OT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u7cfb\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u975e\u8d1f\u6d4b\u5ea6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7OT\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u5728\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff08\u91cd\u5fc3\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u91cd\u5fc3\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u5173\u8054\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u5e38\u6570\u5230\u5730\u9762\u6210\u672c\u786e\u4fdd\u4f20\u8f93\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7684\u51f8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u52a0\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u58f0\u573a\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u7cfb\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method both in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence, compared to the conventional state of-the-art (SotA) techniques, including NN minimization approaches, as well as a mixture of the latter with a matrix factorization approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bcd\u96c6\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u79bb\u6563\u611f\u77e5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684RGB\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u5f20\u91cf\u6761\u76ee\u6765\u81ea\u79bb\u6563\u6709\u9650\u5b57\u6bcd\u96c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u2113\u2080\u8303\u6570\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u79bb\u6563\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u5c06\u2113\u2080\u8303\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u5fae\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6c42\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6838\u8303\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u611f\u77e5\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u5b57\u6bcd\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIDSOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u6ee4\u96e8\u96ea\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u7684LiDAR\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282", "motivation": "\u96e8\u96ea\u5929\u6c14\u4e0bLiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u5e38\u53d7\u5929\u6c14\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5929\u6c14\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9608\u503c", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e73\u4ea4\u9053\u53e3\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u51ac\u5b63\u6076\u52a3\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIDSOR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728WADS\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5747\u8d85\u8fc790%", "conclusion": "IDSOR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5929\u6c14\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18"}}
