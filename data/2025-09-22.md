### [2] [Analysis Plug-and-Play Methods for Imaging Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15422)
*Edward P. Chandler,Shirin Shoushtari,Brendt Wohlberg,Ulugbek S. Kamilov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于梯度域的Plug-and-Play Priors分析公式，通过在梯度域而非图像域训练高斯去噪器，将总变差正则化扩展到学习型TV正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准PnP方法直接在图像域应用去噪器作为隐式先验，本文考虑在图像的变换表示（如梯度）上施加先验，以扩展TV正则化的概念。

Method: 开发了两种分析PnP算法：基于半二次分裂的APnP-HQS和基于交替方向乘子法的APnP-ADMM，将梯度域先验整合到图像重建算法中。

Result: 在图像去模糊和超分辨率任务上的评估表明，分析公式的性能与图像域PnP算法相当。

Conclusion: 梯度域PnP方法为图像重建提供了一种有效的替代方案，将传统TV正则化扩展到数据驱动的学习框架中。

Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse
problems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to
remove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is
applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural
images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in
which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such
as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the
gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an
extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization.
To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms,
we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting
(APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We
evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating
that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain
PnP algorithms.

Abstract: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer
detection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate
capsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images,
addressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate
capsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the
development of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal
loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking
into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The
proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal
loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for
proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust
foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are
difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility,
addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability
by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert
and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the
segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the
prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates
superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a
mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results
highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive
techniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate
capsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve
clinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

*Jay Park,Hong Nguyen,Sean Foley,Jihwan Lee,Yoonjeong Lee,Dani Byrd,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了实时磁共振成像(rtMRI)视频中三种特征表示方法用于音素识别，发现多特征组合模型优于单特征方法，其中ROI和原始视频组合获得了最低的音素错误率0.34。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rtMRI能够可视化声道动作，但其信号高维且噪声大，阻碍了有效解释。研究旨在寻找紧凑的时空发音动态表示方法。

Method: 比较三种特征类型：原始视频、光流和六个语言学相关感兴趣区域(ROI)，评估单特征和多特征组合模型在音素识别任务上的表现。

Result: 多特征模型始终优于单特征基线，ROI和原始视频组合获得最佳性能(PER=0.34)。时间保真度实验显示模型依赖细粒度发音动态，ROI消融研究显示舌和唇区域贡献最大。

Conclusion: rtMRI衍生特征在提供准确性和可解释性方面具有优势，为在语音处理中利用发音数据建立了有效策略。

Abstract: Real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtMRI) visualizes vocal tract action,
offering a comprehensive window into speech articulation. However, its signals
are high dimensional and noisy, hindering interpretation. We investigate
compact representations of spatiotemporal articulatory dynamics for phoneme
recognition from midsagittal vocal tract rtMRI videos. We compare three feature
types: (1) raw video, (2) optical flow, and (3) six linguistically-relevant
regions of interest (ROIs) for articulator movements. We evaluate models
trained independently on each representation, as well as multi-feature
combinations. Results show that multi-feature models consistently outperform
single-feature baselines, with the lowest phoneme error rate (PER) of 0.34
obtained by combining ROI and raw video. Temporal fidelity experiments
demonstrate a reliance on fine-grained articulatory dynamics, while ROI
ablation studies reveal strong contributions from tongue and lips. Our findings
highlight how rtMRI-derived features provide accuracy and interpretability, and
establish strategies for leveraging articulatory data in speech processing.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is
essential for breast cancer diagnosis, yet existing methods face challenges in
capturing irregular tumor shapes and effectively integrating local and global
features. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated
deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and
Transformers. Specifically, we incorporates deformable feature modeling into
both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for
irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module
(U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and
Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global
representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is
introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive
experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art
methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor
delineation.

Abstract: Reliable whole slide imaging (WSI) hinges on image quality,yet staining
artefacts, defocus, and cellular degradations are common. We present DPC-QA
Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global
difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and
membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and
multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different
datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92%
accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it
outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong
positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy
(e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical
pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.

Abstract: Image denoising plays a critical role in biomedical and microscopy imaging,
especially when acquiring wide-field fluorescence-stained images. This task
faces challenges in multiple fronts, including limitations in image acquisition
conditions, complex noise types, algorithm adaptability, and clinical
application demands. Although many deep learning-based denoising techniques
have demonstrated promising results, further improvements are needed in
preserving image details, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, and increasing
clinical interpretability. We propose an unsupervised image denoising method
based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The approach
introduces a multi-scale adaptive generator based on the Wavelet Transform and
a dual-branch discriminator that integrates difference perception feature maps
with original features. Experimental results on multiple biomedical microscopy
image datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art denoising
performance, particularly excelling in the preservation of high-frequency
information. Furthermore, the dual-branch discriminator is seamlessly
compatible with various GAN frameworks. The proposed quality-aware,
wavelet-driven GAN denoising model is termed as QWD-GAN.

Motivation: 3D医学目标检测的大规模预训练研究不足，现有方法未能充分利用3D体积信息，需要系统评估不同预训练方法在检测架构中的效果。

Method: 系统研究现有预训练方法（包括监督、自监督重建和对比学习）在CNN和Transformer检测架构中的集成效果，覆盖多种任务和数据集。

Result: 预训练在所有任务和数据集上一致提升检测性能，重建式自监督预训练表现最佳，对比预训练无明显益处。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training holds the promise to advance 3D medical object
detection, a crucial component of accurate computer-aided diagnosis. Yet, it
remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already
demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D
object detection rely on 2D medical data or natural image pre-training, failing
to fully leverage 3D volumetric information. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into
state-of-the-art detection architectures, covering both CNNs and Transformers.
Our results show that pre-training consistently improves detection performance
across various tasks and datasets. Notably, reconstruction-based
self-supervised pre-training outperforms supervised pre-training, while
contrastive pre-training provides no clear benefit for 3D medical object
detection. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中并非所有MRI模态都可用，缺失模态生成是医学图像分析的关键挑战。

Method: 利用扩散模型从其他可用模态合成四种目标MRI模态，通过专用一致性增强机制确保体积深度的结构连贯性。

Result: 在BraTS-Lighthouse-2025挑战数据集上的定性和定量评估表明，该方法能合成解剖学上合理且结构一致的结果。

Conclusion: SLaM-DiMM框架能有效生成高保真度的MRI模态图像，解决临床实践中模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Brain MRI scans are often found in four modalities, consisting of T1-weighted
with and without contrast enhancement (T1ce and T1w), T2-weighted imaging
(T2w), and Flair. Leveraging complementary information from these different
modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for
understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as
anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are
always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation
a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose
SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the
power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities
from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity
images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume
through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing
anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results. Code is available

### [10] [FMD-TransUNet: Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation Based on Frequency Domain Multi-Axis Representation Learning and Dual Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16044)
*Fang Lu,Jingyu Xu,Qinxiu Sun,Qiong Lou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出FMD-TransUNet框架，通过多轴频率域特征提取和改进的双注意力机制，提升腹部多器官分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以分割小、不规则或解剖结构复杂的器官，且大多关注空间域分析，忽略了频域表示的协同潜力

Method: 在TransUNet框架中集成多轴外部权重块(MEWB)和改进的双注意力模块(DA+)，MEWB提取多轴频域特征，DA+使用深度可分离卷积和空间通道注意力机制

Result: 在Synapse数据集上，平均DSC达到81.32%，HD为16.35mm，相比基线模型DSC提升3.84%，HD降低15.34mm

Conclusion: FMD-TransUNet能有效提高腹部多器官分割的准确性

Abstract: Accurate abdominal multi-organ segmentation is critical for clinical
applications. Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation
methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular,
or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on
spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of
frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ
segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block
(MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet
framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture
both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing
complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block
utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel
attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information,
and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental
validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other
recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD
of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the
average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the
accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.

Conclusion: PRISM为盲逆问题提供了有效的概率鲁棒求解器

Abstract: Diffusion models are now commonly used to solve inverse problems in
computational imaging. However, most diffusion-based inverse solvers require
complete knowledge of the forward operator to be used. In this work, we
introduce a novel probabilistic and robust inverse solver with
measurement-conditioned diffusion prior (PRISM) to effectively address blind
inverse problems. PRISM offers a technical advancement over current methods by
incorporating a powerful measurement-conditioned diffusion model into a
theoretically principled posterior sampling scheme. Experiments on blind image
deblurring validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the
superior performance of PRISM over state-of-the-art baselines in both image and
blur kernel recovery.

Conclusion: 所提出的多RIS辅助RF-FSO混合通信模型在复杂物联网环境中具有优越的安全性能，为6G无线通信提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to their ability to dynamically control the propagation environment,
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a promising solution to
address the challenges of $6$G wireless communication, especially in the
context of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper investigates a mixed
communication model with multi-RIS-aided radio frequency (RF)-free space optics
(FSO) to enhance the performance of IoT applications in complex environments.
An eavesdropper is assumed to be present, attempting to intercept confidential
information transmitted over the RF link. All RF links are modeled using Rician
fading, while the FSO link accounts for M\'alaga turbulence with pointing
errors, capturing real-world propagation conditions. Closed-form analytical
expressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability, average secrecy
capacity, and effective secrecy throughput in terms of Meijer's G function. To
gain further insight, high signal-to-noise approximations of these metrics are
also presented. Numerical results highlight the importance of heterodyne
detection in mitigating the adverse effects of pointing errors on the FSO link.
Moreover, integrating a multi-RIS structure into the proposed model
significantly increases secrecy performance, achieving up to a $47.67\%$
improvement in SOP compared to conventional methods. Finally, the derived
analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限块长流体天线系统（FBL-FAS），通过随机矩阵理论和极值理论分析有限块长对SNR和SINR的影响，推导了BLER和中断概率的闭式表达式，相比传统多天线系统在有限块长下具有更高的能量和频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足6G及未来网络的严格性能指标（包括mMTC、URLLC和eMBB），需要在有限信道使用条件下评估流体天线系统的性能。

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论和极值理论分析有限块长影响，采用Chernoff界和泰勒展开辅助的积分中值定理来降低计算复杂度。

Result: 数值结果表明，相比传统多天线系统，FBL-FAS在有限块长下实现了更高的能量和频谱效率。

Conclusion: FBL-FAS是下一代无线网络的有前景使能技术，特别适用于有限块长通信场景。

Abstract: This work introduces and investigates finite blocklength fluid antenna
systems (FBL-FASs). To meet the stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) of
6G and beyond networks, including ultra-massive machine-type communications
(mMTC), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile
broadband (eMBB), it is necessary to evaluate the performance of FAS under
limited channel uses across time, frequency, and other domains. By exploiting
random matrix theory and extreme value theory (EVT), we characterize the effect
of finite blocklength on key metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), via accurate estimation
of interference caused by codeword correlation. Closed-form expressions for
block error rate (BLER) and outage probability are derived, covering both
conditional BLER (with channel state information, CSI) and statistical BLER
(without CSI). The proposed analysis leverages Chernoff bounds and introduces a
Taylor-expansion-assisted mean value theorem for integrals (MVTI) to reduce
computational complexity. Numerical results show that, compared with
conventional multi-antenna systems, the proposed FBL-FAS framework achieves
higher energy and spectral efficiency under finite blocklength, making it a
promising enabler for next-generation wireless networks.

extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs). Existing NF beam training methods
predominantly rely on beam focusing, where the base station (BS) transmits
highly spatially selective beams to locate the user equipment (UE). However,
these beam-focusing-based schemes suffer from both high beam sweeping overhead
and limited accuracy in the NF, primarily due to the narrow beams' high
susceptibility to misalignment. To address this, we propose a novel NF beam
training paradigm using diverging beams. Specifically, we introduce the beam
diverging effect and exploit it for low-overhead, high-accuracy beam training.
First, we design a diverging codeword to induce the beam diverging effect with
a single radio frequency (RF) chain. Next, we develop a diverging polar-domain
codebook (DPC) along with a hierarchical method that enables angular-domain
localization of the UE with only 2 log_2(N) pilots, where N denotes the number
of antennas. Finally, we enhance beam training performance through two
additional techniques: a DPC angular range reduction strategy to improve the
effectiveness of beam diverging, and a pilot set expansion method to increase
overall beam training accuracy. Numerical results show that our algorithm
achieves near-optimal accuracy with a small pilot overhead, outperforming
existing methods.

*Ran Li,Ziyi Xu,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文针对6G毫米波大规模天线系统中的近场波束训练问题，提出了一种基于波束发散效应的新型训练方法，通过分层码本和3D采样机制实现低开销高性能的波束对准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着6G系统中天线规模增大和载波波长减小，信道模型从远场平面波转变为近场球面波，传统波束训练方法对用户位置失配高度敏感且训练开销过大。

Method: 首先分析UPA系统中的波束发散效应空间特性，构建分层码本进行粗粒度用户定位；然后开发3D采样机制构建近场精化码本进行精确波束训练。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提算法在保持低训练开销的同时实现了优越的波束训练性能。

Conclusion: 基于波束发散效应的新型波束训练方法能够有效解决大规模天线系统中的近场波束训练挑战，为6G通信系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In future 6G communication systems, large-scale antenna arrays promise
enhanced signal strength and spatial resolution, but they also increase the
complexity of beam training. Moreover, as antenna counts grow and carrier
wavelengths shrink, the channel model transits from far-field (FF) planar waves
to near-field (NF) spherical waves, further complicating the beam training
process. This paper focuses on millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems equipped with
large-scale uniform planar arrays (UPAs), which produce 3D beam patterns and
introduce additional challenges for NF beam training. Existing methods
primarily rely on either FF steering or NF focusing codewords, both of which
are highly sensitive to mismatches in user equipment (UE) location, leading to
high sensitivity to even slight mismatch and excessive training overhead. In
contrast, we introduce a novel beam training approach leveraging the
beam-diverging effect, which enables adjustable wide-beam coverage using only a
single radio frequency (RF) chain. Specifically, we first analyze the spatial
characteristics of this effect in UPA systems and leverage them to construct
hierarchical codebooks for coarse UE localization. Then, we develop a 3D
sampling mechanism to build an NF refinement codebook for precise beam
training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves
superior beam training performance while maintaining low training overhead.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出PIMRecGreedy算法，用于学习具有概率重置的高维马尔可夫过程的影响图，无需假设记忆长度或图结构约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅适用于有限记忆的马尔可夫过程，对于系统概率性"时间跳跃"（状态t+1依赖于遥远过去t-d）的更一般情况尚未探索

Method: 基于RecGreedy算法进行修改，提出PIMRecGreedy方法，不假设记忆长度，无需d的先验知识，即使无法访问时间跳跃的具体时间索引也能恢复影响图

Result: 该方法能够以高概率恢复影响图G，且不对图结构施加任何约束

Conclusion: PIMRecGreedy为学习具有概率重置的高维马尔可夫过程提供了一种有效的解决方案，克服了传统方法在计算复杂性和假设限制方面的不足

Abstract: Learning the influence graph G of a high-dimensional Markov process is a
challenging problem. Prior work has addressed this task when the process has
finite memory. However, the more general regime in which the system
probabilistically "jumps back in time" - so that the state at t+1 depends on a
sample from a distant past t-d - remains unexplored. The process with
probabilistic resets can be modeled as a Markov process with memory, but
estimations become computationally expensive. To tackle this, we introduce
PIMRecGreedy, a modification of the RecGreedy algorithm originally designed for
i.i.d. samples. The proposed method does not assume memory, requires no prior
knowledge of d, and recovers G with high probability even without access to the
specific time indices at which such temporal jumps occur, and without imposing
any constraints on the graph structures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究线性二次高斯控制系统中的隐式通信，证明控制系统本身可作为隐式通信信道，控制器通过输入向接收器传输信息，同时满足控制性能约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索控制系统在完成主要控制任务的同时，如何利用系统本身作为通信信道传输信息，避免使用显式通信信道。

Method: 通过隐式信道容量的概念形式化控制与通信性能之间的权衡，分析三种不同观测设置下的信道容量：双方无噪声观测、仅控制器无噪声观测、双方有噪声观测。

Result: 当控制器有无噪声观测时，容量最优输入策略遵循分离原理，可将隐式信道等价转换为高斯MIMO信道，利用现有信道编码实现隐式通信。

Conclusion: 控制系统可有效作为隐式通信信道，在满足控制性能约束下实现可靠通信，分离原理的发现为实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: This paper studies implicit communication in linear quadratic Gaussian
control systems. We show that the control system itself can serve as an
implicit communication channel, enabling the controller to transmit messages
through its inputs to a receiver that observes the system state. This
communication is considered implicit because (i) no explicit communication
channels are needed; and (ii) information is transmitted while simultaneously
fulfilling the controller's primary objective--maintaining the control cost
within a specified level. As a result, there exists an inherent trade-off
between control and communication performance. This trade-off is formalized
through the notion of implicit channel capacity, which characterizes the
supremum reliable communication rate subject to a constraint on control
performance. We characterize the implicit channel capacity in three settings.
When both the controller and the receiver have noiseless observations of the
system state, the channel capacity admits a closed-form expression. When only
the controller has noiseless observations, the channel capacity is given by the
solution of a convex optimization. When both the controller and the receiver
have noisy observations, we establish a lower bound on the implicit capacity.
Surprisingly, when the controller has noiseless observations, the
capacity-achieving input policy adheres to a separation principle, allowing the
control and channel coding tasks to be addressed independently, without loss of
optimality. Moreover, under this capacity-achieving input policy, the implicit
channel can be equivalently translated into a Gaussian MIMO channel, enabling
the use of existing channel codes to achieve implicit communication.

Result: 实验证明(SP)^2-Net在DOA估计方面优于Bartlett波束形成器和基于稀疏性的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的深度学习技术能够有效克服单快照DOA估计的局限性，提供高分辨率空间谱估计。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the directions of arrival (DOAs) of
multiple sources from a single snapshot of an antenna array, a task with many
practical applications. In such settings, the classical Bartlett beamformer is
commonly used, as maximum likelihood estimation becomes impractical when the
number of sources is unknown or large, and spectral methods based on the sample
covariance are not applicable due to the lack of multiple snapshots. However,
the accuracy and resolution of the Bartlett beamformer are fundamentally
limited by the array aperture. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
technique, comprising a novel architecture and training strategy, for
generating a high-resolution spatial spectrum from a single snapshot.
Specifically, we train a deep neural network that takes the measurements and a
hypothesis angle as input and learns to output a score consistent with the
capabilities of a much wider array. At inference time, a heatmap can be
produced by scanning an arbitrary set of angles. We demonstrate the advantages
of our trained model, named (SP)$^2$-Net, over the Bartlett beamformer and
sparsity-based DOA estimation methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates the downlink (DL) transmission in millimeter-wave
(mmWave) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems especially
focusing on a high speed mobile scenario. To complete the DL transmission
within an extremely short channel coherence time, we propose a novel DL
transmission framework that eliminates the need for channel state information
at the transmitter (CSIT), of which acquisition process requires a substantial
overhead, instead fully exploiting the given channel coherence time. Harnessing
the characteristic of mmWave channel and uniquely designed CSIT-free unitary
precoding, we propose a symbol detection method along with the simultaneous CSI
at the receiver (CSIR) and Doppler shift estimation method to completely cancel
the interferences while achieving a full combining gain. Via simulations, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with the
existing baselines.

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology has attracted much research
interest in recent years because of its characteristic helical phase front
twisting around the propagation axis and natural orthogonality among different
OAM states to encode more degrees of freedom than classical planar beams.
Leveraging upon these features, OAM technique has been applied to wireless
communication systems to enhance spectral efficiency and radar systems to
distinguish spatial targets without beam scanning. Leveraging upon these unique
properties, we propose an OAM-based millimeter-wave joint radar-communications
(JRC) system comprising a bi-static automotive radar and vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communications. Different from existing uniform circular array (UCA)
based OAM systems where each element is an isotropic antenna, an OAM spatial
modulation scheme utilizing a uniform linear array (ULA) is adopted with each
element being a traveling-wave antenna, producing multiple Laguerre-Gaussian
(LG) vortex beams simultaneously. Specifically, we first build a novel
bi-static automotive OAM-JRC model that embeds communication messages in a
radar signal, following which a target position and velocity parameters
estimation algorithm is designed with only radar frames. Then, an OAM-based
mode-division multiplexing (MDM) strategy between radar and JRC frames is
presented to ensure the JRC parameters identifiability and recovery.
Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the JRC system through deriving
recovery guarantees and Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of radar target
parameters and evaluating the bit error rate (BER) of communication,
respectively. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed OAM-based JRC system and parameter estimation method.

Abstract: Identification and further analysis of radar emitters in a contested
environment requires detection and separation of incoming signals. If they
arrive from the same direction and at similar frequencies, deinterleaving them
remains challenging. A solution to overcome this limitation becomes
increasingly important with the advancement of emitter capabilities. We propose
treating the problem as blind source separation in time domain and apply
supervisedly trained neural networks to extract the underlying signals from the
received mixture. This allows us to handle highly overlapping and also
continuous wave (CW) signals from both radar and communication emitters. We
make use of advancements in the field of audio source separation and extend a
current state-of-the-art model with the objective of deinterleaving arbitrary
radio frequency (RF) signals. Results show, that our approach is capable of
separating two unknown waveforms in a given frequency band with a single
channel receiver.

Abstract: Future wireless networks are envisioned to deliver not only gigabit
communications but also ubiquitous sensing. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs) have emerged to reshape radio propagation, recently showing considerable
promise for wireless sensing. Still, their per-element electronic tuning incurs
prohibitive hardware cost and power consumption. Motivated by the concept of
fluid antenna system (FAS), this paper introduces a low-cost movable
intelligent surface (MIS) for wireless sensing, which replaces element-wise
electronic phase tuning with panel-wise mechanical reconfiguration. The MIS
stacks a large fixed and a smaller movable pre-phased metasurface layers, whose
differential position shifts synthesize distinct composite phase patterns,
enabling multiple beam patterns for multi-target detection. We characterize a
MIS-enabled multi-hop echo signal model with multi-target interference and then
formulate a worst-case sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
maximization problem that jointly designs MIS phase shifts and schedules MS2's
position. A Riemannian Augmented Lagrangian Method (RALM)-based algorithm is
developed to solve the formulated mixed-integer non-convex problem. We also
derive a heuristic MIS beam steering design with closed-form phase distribution
and position scheduling. Simulations validate MIS's beam pattern
reconfiguration capability, show that the RALM-based scheme significantly
outperforms the closed-form scheme in improving sensing SINR, and uncover a
gain-diversity trade-off in beam patterns that informs the optimal choice of
MIS configuration.

Abstract: In increasing number of electronic devices implement wideband radio
technologies for localization and sensing purposes, like ultra-wideband (UWB).
Such radio technologies benefit from a large number of antennas, but space for
antennas is often limited, especially in devices for mobile and IoT
applications. A common challenge is therefore to optimize the placement and
orientations of a small number of antenna elements inside a device, leading to
the best localization performance. We propose a method for systematically
approaching the optimization of such sparse arrays by means of Cram\'er-Rao
lower bounds (CRLBs) and vector spherical wave functions (VSWFs). The VSWFs
form the basis of a wideband signal model considering frequency, direction and
polarization-dependent characteristics of the antenna array under test (AUT),
together with mutual coupling and distortions from surrounding obstacles. We
derive the CRLBs for localization parameters like delay and angle-of-arrival
for this model under additive white Gaussian noise channel conditions, and
formulate optimization problems for determining optimal antenna positions and
orientations via minimization of the CRLBs. The proposed optimization procedure
is demonstrated by means of an exemplary arrangement of three Crossed
Exponentially Tapered Slot (XETS) antennas.

Abstract: This study proposes a small-scale fading model, named the extended k-u model,
which incorporates the imbalance of multipath clusters by adding a new

the k-u model in characterizing small-scale fading in the millimeter-wave

model in scenarios with line-of-sight (LoS) paths. And it is mathematically
more tractable than the a-k-n-u model. Experiments are conducted for mmWave
communication scenarios with LoS paths, covering the outdoor 28 GHz band, the
indoor 65 GHz band, and the indoor 92 GHz band. The results demonstrate that
the extended k-u model achieves a smaller mean square error in fitting the
measured data compared to both the k-u model and the extended n-u model across
all scenarios. In addition, through theoretical derivations, closed-form
expressions are obtained for the key statistical characteristics of the
extended k-u model, including the probability density function, cumulative
distribution function, moments of arbitrary order, and moment generating
function. Based on these statistics, this study further derives and analyzes
the expressions for some performance metrics of the communication system,
including the amount of fading, the probability of outage, and the average bit
error rate.

Abstract: Wireless signal recognition (WSR) is crucial in modern and future wireless
communication networks since it aims to identify the properties of the received
signal in a no-collaborative manner. However, it is challenging to accurately
classify signals in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and distributed
network settings. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed multi-task
learning framework for joint wireless signal enhancement and recognition
(WSER), addressing the crucial need for non-collaborative signal identification
in modern wireless networks. Our approach integrates a wireless signal
enhancement and recognition network (WSERNet) with FedProx+, an enhanced
federated learning algorithm designed for heterogeneous data distributions.
Specifically, WSERNet leverages an asymmetric convolution block (ACBlock) to
capture long-range dependencies in the input signal and improve the performance
of the deep learning model. FedProx+ introduces a proximal term to the loss
function to encourage the model updates to be closer to the previous model,
enhancing the convergence speed and robustness of federated learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for joint
WSER, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under
both centralized and distributed settings including independent and identically
distributed (IID) and non-IID data distributions.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied to enhance automatic modulation
classification (AMC). However, the elaborate AMC neural networks are
susceptible to various adversarial attacks, which are challenging to handle due
to the generalization capability and computational cost. In this article, an
explainable DL based defense scheme, called SHapley Additive exPlanation
enhanced Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SHAP-AFT), is developed in the perspective of
disclosing the attacking impact on the AMC network. By introducing the concept
of cognitive negative information, the motivation of using SHAP for defense is
theoretically analyzed first. The proposed scheme includes three stages, i.e.,
the attack detection, the information importance evaluation, and the AFT. The
first stage indicates the existence of the attack. The second stage evaluates
contributions of the received data and removes those data positions using
negative Shapley values corresponding to the dominating negative information
caused by the attack. Then the AMC network is fine-tuned based on adversarial
adaptation samples using the refined received data pattern. Simulation results
show the effectiveness of the Shapley value as the key indicator as well as the
superior defense performance of the proposed SHAP-AFT scheme in face of
different attack types and intensities.

Method: 开发了端到端统一信号模型，通过贝叶斯克拉美罗下界分析推导感知精度，并建立了考虑相位噪声和功放非线性的通信容量闭式表达式。

Result: 发现感知估计方差随载波频率呈1/f_c^2改善，但受硬件失真限制；通信性能受硬件限制而非功率限制，推导出容量上限公式；数值结果表明亚太赫兹频段(200-600 GHz)可能存在有利工作条件。

Conclusion: 功放非线性是主要性能瓶颈，超过其他损伤1-2个数量级；在亚太赫兹频段，感知增益与硬件质量退化之间存在平衡点。

Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing the fundamental
performance limits of terahertz (THz) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) inter-satellite
link (ISL) Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems. We develop a
unified, end-to-end signal model that, jointly captures the effects of extreme
orbital dynamics, cascaded non-ideal hardware impairments, and micro-radian
beam pointing errors. Through Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB)
analysis, we derive the ultimate sensing accuracy for range and range-rate,
revealing a quadratic ($1/f_c^2$) improvement in estimation variance with
carrier frequency, which is ultimately floored by signal-dependent hardware
distortion. For communication, we show that system performance is not
power-limited but hardware-limited, deriving a closed-form capacity ceiling
under the joint effect of phase noise and PA nonlinearity: $C_{\text{sat}} =
\log_2(1 + e^{-\sigma_\phi^2}/\Gamma_{\text{eff}})$, where
$\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$ is a proposed hardware quality factor. Our numerical
results, based on state-of-the-art component data and the identified
trade-offs, suggest that favorable operational conditions may exist in the
sub-THz frequency range (200-600 GHz) where the quadratic sensing gain with
frequency is balanced against hardware quality degradation. Power Amplifier
(PA) nonlinearity emerges as the dominant performance bottleneck, exceeding
other impairments by one to two orders of magnitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无线信道基础模型都是基于完美CSI数据训练的，但实际系统中只能获得降级的CSI，导致特征表示无法反映真实信道特性，造成下游任务性能下降。

Method: 首先获取粗略的CSI估计，计算两个投影矩阵提取接收信号中的NPI项，通过NPI估计和减法模块处理，最后通过CSI补全网络获得干净的CSI用于特征提取。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与现有解决方案相比，具有NPI抑制结构的WCFM在信道预测任务上实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 提出的NPI抑制架构能够有效处理实际系统中的噪声和干扰问题，提高了无线信道基础模型在真实环境中的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Wireless channel foundation model (WCFM) is a task-agnostic AI model that is
pretrained on large-scale wireless channel datasets to learn a universal
channel feature representation that can be used for a wide range of downstream
tasks related to communications and sensing. While existing works on WCFM have
demonstrated its great potentials in various tasks including beam prediction,
channel prediction, localization, etc, the models are all trained using perfect
(i.e., error-free and complete) channel information state (CSI) data which are
generated with simulation tools. However, in practical systems where the WCFM
is deployed, perfect CSI is not available. Instead, channel estimation needs to
be first performed based on pilot signals over a subset of the resource
elements (REs) to acquire a noisy version of the CSI (termed as degraded CSI),
which significantly differs from the perfect CSI in some real-world
environments with severe noise and interference. As a result, the feature
representation generated by the WCFM is unable to reflect the characteristics
of the true channel, yielding performance degradation in downstream tasks. To
address this issue, in this paper we propose an enhanced wireless channel
foundation model architecture with noise-plus-interference (NPI) suppression
capability. In our approach, coarse estimates of the CSIs are first obtained.
With these information, two projection matrices are computed to extract the NPI
terms in the received signals, which are further processed by a NPI estimation
and subtraction module. Finally, the resultant signal is passed through a CSI
completion network to get a clean version of the CSI, which is used for feature
extraction. Simulation results demonstrated that compared to the
state-of-the-art solutions, WCFM with NPI suppression structure achieves
improved performance on channel prediction task.

### [31] [MoE-CE: Enhancing Generalization for Deep Learning based Channel Estimation via a Mixture-of-Experts Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15964)
*Tianyu Li,Yan Xin,Jianzhong,Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MoE-CE是一种基于混合专家框架的信道估计方法，旨在提升深度学习模型在动态无线环境中的泛化能力，特别是在多任务和零样本场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在动态无线环境中难以有效泛化，特别是在不同信噪比、资源块数量和信道配置等多样化条件下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MoE-CE框架，利用多个专门处理不同信道特性的专家子网络和动态路由机制，根据输入特征选择最相关的专家，提高模型容量和适应性而不显著增加计算成本。

Result: 在多样化SNR、RB数量和信道配置的合成数据集上进行广泛实验，包括多任务和零样本评估，MoE-CE始终优于传统深度学习方法，获得显著性能提升并保持效率。

Conclusion: MoE-CE框架通过混合专家架构有效提升了信道估计的泛化能力，为动态无线环境中的鲁棒通信提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable channel estimation (CE) is fundamental for robust communication in
dynamic wireless environments, where models must generalize across varying
conditions such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), the number of resource blocks
(RBs), and channel profiles. Traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods
struggle to generalize effectively across such diverse settings, particularly
under multitask and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose MoE-CE, a
flexible mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework designed to enhance the
generalization capability of DL-based CE methods. MoE-CE provides an
appropriate inductive bias by leveraging multiple expert subnetworks, each
specialized in distinct channel characteristics, and a learned router that
dynamically selects the most relevant experts per input. This architecture
enhances model capacity and adaptability without a proportional rise in
computational cost while being agnostic to the choice of the backbone model and
the learning algorithm. Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets
generated under diverse SNRs, RB numbers, and channel profiles, including
multitask and zero-shot evaluations, we demonstrate that MoE-CE consistently
outperforms conventional DL approaches, achieving significant performance gains
while maintaining efficiency.

*Yiming Zhou,Wei Dai*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出一种近端共轭梯度法（PCG），用于求解包含可微函数q和非光滑函数h的复合最小化问题，该方法在保持快速收敛的同时降低了计算和内存复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号处理和机器学习中大规模、病态和非凸复合最小化问题的计算效率挑战

Method: 基于共轭梯度迭代构建牛顿方向的近似，构造曲率感知的代理函数，并利用CG导出的各向同性权重保证局部二阶模型的主化

Result: 数值实验在非凸正则化的CS-MRI和字典学习问题上验证了方法的效率

Conclusion: PCG方法能够有效处理非凸复合优化问题，在保持收敛性的同时显著降低计算复杂度

Abstract: This work studies a composite minimization problem involving a differentiable
function q and a nonsmooth function h, both of which may be nonconvex. This
problem is ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning yet remains
challenging to solve efficiently, particularly when large-scale instances, poor
conditioning, and nonconvexity coincide. To address these challenges, we
propose a proximal conjugate gradient method (PCG) that matches the fast
convergence of proximal (quasi-)Newton algorithms while reducing computation
and memory complexity, and is especially effective for spectrally clustered
Hessians. Our key innovation is to form, at each iteration, an approximation to
the Newton direction based on CG iterations to build a majorization surrogate.
We define this surrogate in a curvature-aware manner and equip it with a
CG-derived isotropic weight, guaranteeing majorization of a local second-order
model of q along the given direction. To better preserve majorization after the
proximal step and enable further approximation refinement, we scale the CG
direction by the ratio between the Cauchy step length and a step size derived
from the largest Ritz value of the CG tridiagonal. All curvature is accessed
via Hessian-vector products computed by automatic differentiation, keeping the
method Hessian-free. Convergence to first-order critical points is established.
Numerical experiments on CS-MRI with nonconvex regularization and on dictionary
learning, against benchmark methods, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
approach.

Abstract: This article investigates secure multicast communications in pinching-antenna
systems (PASS), where pinching beamforming is enabled by adaptively adjusting
pinching antenna (PAs) positions along waveguides to improve multicast
security. Specifically, a PASS-based secure multicast framework is proposed, in
which joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is conducted to
maximize the secrecy multicast rate. i) For the single-group multicast
scenario, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is employed, where the
pinching beamformer is updated via an element-wise sequential optimization
method. The transmit beamformer is designed via a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
formulation for an upper-bound solution, while a Dinkelbach-alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) offers a low-complexity alternative. ii)
For the multi-group multicast scenario, transmit and pinching beamformers are
alternately optimized under a majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The
transmit beamformer is obtained via SDR or an efficient second-order cone
programming (SOCP) method, while the pinching beamformer is updated through
MM-based element-wise sequential update strategy. Numerical results are
provided to demonstrate that: (i) PASS consistently outperform conventional
fixed-location antenna architectures in terms of secrecy performance across
various configurations; and (ii) the performance advantage of PASS over
fixed-location architectures becomes more significant with increased service
region, larger antenna arrays, and higher user and eavesdropper densities.

TL;DR: 本研究首次在垂直涡轮泵的浸没式叶轮上部署封装加速度计，实现原位振动监测，通过机器学习模型分析显示该传感器比非浸没传感器表现更优，且封装不影响性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安装在电机上的加速度计无法检测暴露在恶劣井下环境中的浸没叶轮故障，需要开发能够直接监测关键浸没部件的方法。

Method: 在实验室规模的泵装置中使用1米油浸没深度，在正常和模拟故障条件下收集振动数据，使用传统和深度学习的机器学习模型分析传感器有效性。

Conclusion: 这种首创的原位监测系统证明，封装保护的叶轮安装传感器能够可靠检测关键浸没泵部件的故障，实现更早的故障检测，减少非计划停机时间。

Abstract: Vertical turbine pumps in oil and gas operations rely on motor-mounted
accelerometers for condition monitoring. However, these sensors cannot detect
faults at submerged impellers exposed to harsh downhole environments. We
present the first study deploying encapsulated accelerometers mounted directly
on submerged impeller bowls, enabling in-situ vibration monitoring. Using a
lab-scale pump setup with 1-meter oil submergence, we collected vibration data
under normal and simulated fault conditions. The data were analyzed using a
suite of machine learning models -- spanning traditional and deep learning
methods -- to evaluate sensor effectiveness. Impeller-mounted sensors achieved
91.3% average accuracy and 0.973 AUC-ROC, outperforming the best non-submerged
sensor. Crucially, encapsulation caused no statistically significant
performance loss in sensor performance, confirming its viability for
oil-submerged environments. While the lab setup used shallow submergence,
real-world pump impellers operate up to hundreds of meters underground -- well
beyond the range of surface-mounted sensors. This first-of-its-kind in-situ
monitoring system demonstrates that impeller-mounted sensors -- encapsulated
for protection while preserving diagnostic fidelity -- can reliably detect
faults in critical submerged pump components. By capturing localized vibration
signatures that are undetectable from surface-mounted sensors, this approach
enables earlier fault detection, reduces unplanned downtime, and optimizes
maintenance for downhole systems in oil and gas operations.

Conclusion: Pulsar系统设计具有互操作性，能够与现有GNSS接收器兼容，为全球定位、导航和授时生态系统提供厘米级精度、韧性和认证功能

Abstract: At least ten emerging providers are developing satellite navigation systems
for low Earth orbit (LEO). Compatibility with existing GNSS in L-band is
critical to their successful deployment and for the larger ecosystem. Xona is
deploying Pulsar, a near 260-satellite LEO constellation offering dual L-band
navigation services near L1 and L5. Designed for interoperability, Pulsar
provides centimeter-level accuracy, resilience, and authentication, while
maintaining a format that existing GNSS receivers can support through a
firmware update. This study examines Pulsar's compatibility with GPS and
Galileo by evaluating C/N0 degradation caused by the introduction of its X1 and
X5 signals. Using spectrally compact QPSK modulation, Pulsar minimizes
interference despite higher signal power. Theoretical analysis is supported by
hardware testing across a range of commercial GNSS receivers in both lab-based
simulation and in-orbit live-sky conditions. The study confirms Pulsar causes
no adverse interference effects to existing GNSS, supporting coexistence and
integration within the global PNT ecosystem.
