### [1] [(2,2)-GB Codes: Classification and Comparison with weight-4 Surface Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21237)
*François Arnault,Philippe Gaborit,Nicolas Saussay*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种新型的(2,2)-广义自行车码（GB码）家族，其性能与Kitaev环面码和最佳2D权重-4表面码相当，甚至打破了关于偶距离GB码不可能最优的传统观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索比表面码更优的量子纠错码，特别是针对(2,2)-GB码的构造和性能优化。

Method: 利用二元循环矩阵对构造(2,2)-GB码，并引入CSS保持的等价关系以严格比较基于Cayley图的CSS码。

Result: 构造了三个无限家族的最优(2,2)-GB码，其参数分别为[[2n², 2, n]]、[[4r², 2, 2r]]和[[(2t + 1)² + 1, 2, 2t + 1]]。

Conclusion: 这些GB码家族在性能上达到了已知理论极限，部分结果打破了传统观念，为量子纠错提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes offer a compelling alternative to surface
codes for quantum error correction. This paper focuses on (2,2)-Generalized
Bicycle codes, constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two
non-zero elements per row. Leveraging a lower bound on their minimum distance,
we construct three novel infinite families of optimal (2,2)-GB codes with
parameters [[ 2n^2, 2, n ]], [[ 4r^2, 2, 2r ]], and [[(2t + 1)^2 + 1, 2, 2t + 1
]]. These families match the performance of Kitaev's toric code and the best 2D
weight-4 surface codes, reaching known theoretical limits. In particular, the
second family breaks a long-held belief by providing optimal even-distance GB
codes, previously deemed impossible.
  All are CSS codes derived from Cayley graphs. Recognizing that standard
equivalence relations do not preserve their CSS structure, we introduce a
CSS-preserving equivalence relation for rigorous comparison of Cayley
graph-based CSS codes. Under this framework, the first two families are
inequivalent to all previously known optimal weight-4 2D surface codes, while
the third family is equivalent to the best-known odd-distance 2D surface code.
  Finally, we classify all extremal, non-equivalent (2,2)-GB codes with length
below 200 and present a comparison table with existing notable 2D weight-4
surface codes.

### [2] [Distributed Iterative ML and Message Passing for Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21363)
*Zilu Zhao,Christian Forsch,Laura Cottatellucci,Dirk Slock*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种分布式算法，结合GF和CF-MaMIMO，用于活动检测、数据检测和信道估计，解决了大规模设备连接中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网的发展，GF接入方案成为支持大规模设备连接的有前景的解决方案，但其与CF-MaMIMO的集成带来了活动检测和导频污染缓解的挑战。

Method: 采用分布式ML方法进行活动检测，随后提出PP-VB-EP算法进行联合数据检测和信道估计，并开发了分布式VL-EP算法计算伪先验。

Result: PP-VB-EP相比传统VB-EP表现出更好的收敛性和对初始化的鲁棒性，伪先验作为正则化项防止算法发散。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式算法有效解决了GF与CF-MaMIMO集成中的关键问题，为下一代无线通信提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered
one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless
communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the
Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support
massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces
significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for
activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we
propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method
first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data
portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid
Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint
data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the
proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced
sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a
finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated
posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing
(MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed
fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level
Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究群码在有限域中的存在性，特别是壳维数的限制条件，以推广先前仅适用于阿贝尔群的结果。

Method: 通过证明一般性判据，并具体应用于壳维数≤3的情况，尤其是1维壳维数的群码。

Result: 得出了群码存在的一般性判据，并具体给出了壳维数≤3的群码存在条件。

Conclusion: 研究推广了先前仅适用于阿贝尔群的结果，为更广泛的群码存在性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be a finite field and $G$ a finte group with $(|G|,q)=1$.
By a group code in $\mathbb {F}_q[G]$ we mean a two-sided ideal in $\mathbb
{F}_q[G]$. We will prove a general criterion for the existence of group codes
with given hull dimension, and then apply it to deduce explicit criterions for
existence of group codes with hull dimension $\leq3$. In particular our
criterion for the existence of $1$-dimensional hulls generalizes that of
privious work which consider only abelian groups $G$.

### [4] [Beamforming Saturation in Two-Timescale RIS-assisted Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21776)
*Masoud Sadeghian,Angel Lozano,Gabor Fodor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于可重构智能表面（RIS）的无线通信，重点分析了双时间尺度方法，通过基于信道统计优化RIS相移以减少信道估计开销。研究发现，虽然RIS捕获的功率随其元素数量线性增长，但双时间尺度波束成形增益在RIS元素增加时迅速饱和，最终增益由功率角度谱（PAS）的衰减率决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少RIS辅助通信中的信道估计开销，优化RIS相移以提高通信效率。

Method: 采用双时间尺度方法，基于信道统计优化RIS相移，分析RIS元素数量与波束成形增益的关系。

Result: RIS捕获的功率随元素数量线性增长，但波束成形增益在元素增加时迅速饱和，最终由PAS衰减率决定。

Conclusion: RIS辅助通信的有效性受PAS衰减率影响，需进一步研究以优化性能。

Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the
RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the
overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power
captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the
two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates
rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power
angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay
rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly
spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this
saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.

### [5] [Pilot-to-Data Power Ratio in RIS-Assisted Multiantenna Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21785)
*Masoud Sadeghian,Angel Lozano,Gabor Fodor*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了在RIS辅助网络中优化PDPR以减少导频开销，并通过闭式解验证了其在大规模RIS元素或信道相干性增强时的显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PDPR在蜂窝网络中的优化已被广泛研究，但其在RIS辅助网络中的作用尚未充分探讨。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过基于信道统计调整RIS相移，优化PDPR以减少导频开销，并推导出闭式解。

Result: 在宏蜂窝部署场景中，优化PDPR在多种操作条件下均表现出显著优势，尤其是在RIS元素数量或信道相干性增加时。

Conclusion: 优化PDPR在RIS辅助网络中具有重要价值，特别是在大规模RIS或高信道相干性条件下。

Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems
to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While
the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied
extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has
hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the
communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis
of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a
macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be
significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,
demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a
closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS
elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.

### [6] [Properties of Algorithmic Information Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21988)
*Marcus Hutter*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了未归一化的算法信息距离$d_K$的理论性质，探讨了其作为度量以外的特性，并展示了其在（无限）维空间中的嵌入能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索算法信息距离$d_K$的额外性质，以补充现有归一化信息距离的应用。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了$d_K$在有限字符串空间中的嵌入性质，并验证其是否为欧几里得距离。

Result: 发现$d_K$不是欧几里得距离，但有限欧几里得空间点可嵌入到$d_K$空间中。

Conclusion: 为未来研究$d_K$的性质提供了框架和工具，并提出了若干开放问题。

Abstract: The domain-independent universal Normalized Information Distance based on
Kolmogorov complexity has been (in approximate form) successfully applied to a
variety of difficult clustering problems. In this paper we investigate
theoretical properties of the un-normalized algorithmic information distance
$d_K$. The main question we are asking in this work is what properties this
curious distance has, besides being a metric. We show that many
(in)finite-dimensional spaces can(not) be isometrically scale-embedded into the
space of finite strings with metric $d_K$. We also show that $d_K$ is not an
Euclidean distance, but any finite set of points in Euclidean space can be
scale-embedded into $(\{0,1\}^*,d_K)$. A major contribution is the development
of the necessary framework and tools for finding more (interesting) properties
of $d_K$ in future, and to state several open problems.

### [7] [DOA Estimation via Continuous Aperture Arrays: MUSIC and CRLB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21347)
*Haonan Si,Zhaolin Wang,Xiansheng Guo,Jin Zhang,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于连续孔径阵列（CAPA）的到达方向（DOA）估计，提出了一种新的MUSIC算法，解决了传统算法不适用的问题，并通过理论分析和数值结果验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散阵列（SPDA）在DOA估计中自由度有限，而CAPA能显著提升自由度，但其连续信号特性使得传统算法无法直接应用。

Method: 提出了一种新的MUSIC算法，通过连续-离散变换实现连续算子的特征分解，并利用高斯-勒让德积分近似MUSIC谱以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 理论证明CAPA显著提高了DOA估计精度，数值结果验证了算法的有效性，实现了接近最优的估计性能且计算复杂度低。

Conclusion: CAPA结合新MUSIC算法在DOA估计中表现出色，优于传统SPDA，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation using continuous aperture array (CAPA)
is studied. Compared to the conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), CAPA
significantly enhances the spatial degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs) for DOA
estimation, but its infinite-dimensional continuous signals render the
conventional estimation algorithm non-applicable. To address this challenge, a
new multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is proposed for CAPAs. In
particular, an equivalent continuous-discrete transformation is proposed to
facilitate the eigendecomposition of continuous operators. Subsequently, the
MUSIC spectrum is accurately approximated using the Gauss-Legendre quadrature,
effectively reducing the computational complexity. Furthermore, the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for DOA estimation using CAPAs are analyzed
for both cases with and without priori knowledge of snapshot signals. It is
theoretically proved that CAPAs significantly improve the DOA estimation
accuracy compared to traditional SPDAs. Numerical results further validate this
insight and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MUSIC algorithm for
CAPA. The proposed method achieves near-optimal estimation performance while
maintaining a low computational complexity.

### [8] [Transmission With Machine Language Tokens: A Paradigm for Task-Oriented Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21454)
*Zhuoran Xiao,Chenhui Ye,Yijia Feng,Yunbo Hu,Tianyu Jiao,Liyu Cai,Guangyi Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向任务的智能体通信系统，利用LLM学习专用机器语言，结合多模态LLM提取任务信息，并通过JTCC方案减少传输开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来生产过程中智能体将成为主要参与者，需要为智能体通信设计新型AI原生系统，现有LLM输出的人类语言不适用于智能体通信。

Method: 利用原始LLM学习专用机器语言，训练多模态LLM提取任务信息并表达为机器语言，引入JTCC方案压缩令牌序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少了传输开销并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的系统为智能体通信提供了高效解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement in large foundation models is propelling the paradigm
shifts across various industries. One significant change is that agents,
instead of traditional machines or humans, will be the primary participants in
the future production process, which consequently requires a novel AI-native
communication system tailored for agent communications. Integrating the ability
of large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented semantic communication is a
potential approach. However, the output of existing LLM is human language,
which is highly constrained and sub-optimal for agent-type communication. In
this paper, we innovatively propose a task-oriented agent communication system.
Specifically, we leverage the original LLM to learn a specialized machine
language represented by token embeddings. Simultaneously, a multi-modal LLM is
trained to comprehend the application task and to extract essential implicit
information from multi-modal inputs, subsequently expressing it using machine
language tokens. This representation is significantly more efficient for
transmission over the air interface. Furthermore, to reduce transmission
overhead, we introduce a joint token and channel coding (JTCC) scheme that
compresses the token sequence by exploiting its sparsity while enhancing
robustness against channel noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach reduces transmission overhead for downstream tasks while enhancing
accuracy relative to the SOTA methods.

### [9] [Two-Dimensional Nonseparable Fractional Fourier Transform: Theory and Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21511)
*Daxiang Li,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更通用的二维非可分离分数傅里叶变换（NSFRFT），解决了现有二维FRFT方法的局限性，并在图像加密、去噪等应用中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有二维FRFT方法在理论统一性、处理非可分离信号及保持与Wigner分布的旋转关系方面存在不足，限制了其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 提出2D NSFRFT，具有四个自由度，包含现有方法为特例，并推导其性质及三种离散算法，其中两种为快速算法。

Result: 数值模拟和实验表明，2D NSFRFT在图像加密、解密、滤波和去噪等应用中性能优越。

Conclusion: 2D NSFRFT是一种更通用的方法，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) generalizes the
1D Fourier transform, offering significant advantages in time-frequency
analysis of non-stationary signals. To extend the benefits of the 1D FRFT to
higher-dimensional signals, 2D FRFTs, such as the 2D separable FRFT (SFRFT),
gyrator transform (GT), and coupled FRFT (CFRFT), have been developed. However,
existing 2D FRFTs suffer from several limitations: (1) a lack of theoretical
uniformity and general applicability, (2) an inability to handle 2D
non-stationary signals with nonseparable terms, and (3) failure to maintain a
consistent 4D rotational relationship with the 2D Wigner distribution (WD),
which is essential for ensuring geometric consistency and symmetry in
time-frequency analysis. These limitations restrict the methods' performance in
practical applications, such as radar, communication, sonar, and optical
imaging, in which nonseparable terms frequently arise. To address these
challenges, we introduce a more general definition of the 2D FRFT, termed the
2D nonseparable FRFT (NSFRFT). The 2D NSFRFT has four degrees of freedom,
includes the 2D SFRFT, GT, and CFRFT as special cases, and maintains a more
general 4D rotational relationship with the 2D WD. We derive its properties and
present three discrete algorithms, two of which are fast algorithms with
computational complexity $O(N^2 \log N)$ comparable to that of the 2D SFRFT.
Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
the 2D NSFRFT in applications such as image encryption, decryption, filtering,
and denoising.

### [10] [Trainable Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21527)
*Ziqi Yan,Zhichao Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

Conclusion: 提出的参数自适应学习滤波框架有效优化了时变图信号处理，兼具高效性和性能提升。

Abstract: To address limitations of the graph fractional Fourier transform (GFRFT)
Wiener filtering and the traditional joint time-vertex fractional Fourier
transform (JFRFT) Wiener filtering, this study proposes a filtering method
based on the hyper-differential form of the JFRFT. The gradient backpropagation
mechanism is employed to enable the adaptive selection of transform order pair
and filter coefficients. First, leveraging the hyper-differential form of the
GFRFT and the fractional Fourier transform, the hyper-differential form of the
JFRFT is constructed and its properties are analyzed. Second, time-varying
graph signals are divided into dynamic graph sequences of equal span along the
temporal dimension. A spatiotemporal joint representation is then established
through vectorized reorganization, followed by the joint time-vertex Wiener
filtering. Furthermore, by rigorously proving the differentiability of the
transform orders, both the transform orders and filter coefficients are
embedded as learnable parameters within a neural network architecture. Through
gradient backpropagation, their synchronized iterative optimization is
achieved, constructing a parameters-adaptive learning filtering framework. This
method leverages a model-driven approach to learn the optimal transform order
pair and filter coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
framework improves the time-varying graph signals denoising performance, while
reducing the computational burden of the traditional grid search strategy.

### [11] [Causal Link Discovery with Unequal Edge Error Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21570)
*Joni Shaska,Urbashi Mitra*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neyman-Pearson因果发现的新框架，用于控制不对称错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现算法未区分边错误类型，也无法提供有限样本保证。

Method: 结合信息论技术，提出线性加性高斯噪声模型的epsilon-CUT算法。

Result: 在控制假阳性率的同时，性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为因果发现提供了有限样本保证和错误控制灵活性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for causal discovery with asymmetric
error control, called Neyman-Pearson causal discovery. Despite the importance
of applications where different types of edge errors may have different
importance, current state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms do not
differentiate between the types of edge errors, nor provide any finite-sample
guarantees on the edge errors. Hence, this framework seeks to minimize one type
of error while keeping the other below a user-specified tolerance level. Using
techniques from information theory, fundamental performance limits are found,
characterized by the R\'enyi divergence, for Neyman-Pearson causal discovery.
Furthermore, a causal discovery algorithm is introduced for the case of linear
additive Gaussian noise models, called epsilon-CUT, that provides finite-sample
guarantees on the false positive rate, while staying competitive with
state-of-the-art methods.

### [12] [Affine Invariant Semi-Blind Receiver: Joint Channel Estimation and High-Order Signal Detection for Multiuser Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21593)
*Erdeng Zhang,Shuntian Zheng,Sheng Wu,Haoge Jia,Zhe Ji,Ailing Xiao*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型半盲联合信道估计与信号检测（JCESD）方法，用于高密度用户场景下的MIMO-OFDM系统，通过混合预编码抑制干扰，利用星座不变性优化，提升频谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高用户密度导致严重的用户间干扰和导频开销增加，现有盲和半盲方法在频率选择性信道和高阶调制下性能下降。

Method: 采用混合预编码架构抑制干扰，将JCESD建模为非凸星座拟合优化问题，利用少量导频进行初始化和模糊消除，通过数据增强和迭代细化提升性能。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在多用户场景下，平均吞吐量比广泛使用的基于导频的方法提高了11%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升频谱效率，适用于未来高密度无线网络。

Abstract: Massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are foundational for downlink multi-user
(MU) communication in future wireless networks, for their ability to enhance
spectral efficiency and support a large number of users simultaneously.
However, high user density intensifies severe inter-user interference (IUI) and
pilot overhead. Consequently, existing blind and semi-blind channel estimation
(CE) and signal detection (SD) algorithms suffer performance degradation and
increased complexity, especially when further challenged by frequency-selective
channels and high-order modulation demands. To this end, this paper proposes a
novel semi-blind joint channel estimation and signal detection (JCESD) method.
Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid precoding architecture to
suppress IUI. Furthermore we formulate JCESD as a non-convex constellation
fitting optimization exploiting constellation affine invariance. Few pilots are
used to achieve coarse estimation for initialization and ambiguity resolution.
For high-order modulations, a data augmentation mechanism utilizes the symmetry
of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations to increase the
effective number of samples. To address frequency-selective channels, CE
accuracy is then enhanced via an iterative refinement strategy that leverages
improved SD results. Simulation results demonstrate an average throughput gain
of 11\% over widely used pilot-based methods in MU scenarios, highlighting the
proposed method's potential to improve spectral efficiency.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO is a key 6G technology, offering superior spectral and
energy efficiency. However, its dense deployment of low-cost access points
(APs) makes hardware impairments unavoidable. While narrowband impairments are
well-studied, their impact in wideband systems remains unexplored. This paper
provides the first comprehensive analysis of hardware impairments, such as
nonlinear distortion in low-noise amplifiers, phase noise, in-phase-quadrature
imbalance, and low-resolution analog-to-digital converters, on uplink spectral
efficiency in cell-free massive MIMO. Using an OFDM waveform and centralized
processing, APs share channel state information for joint uplink combining.
Leveraging Bussgang decomposition, we derive a distortion-aware combining
vector that optimizes spectral efficiency by modeling distortion as independent
colored noise.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key enabler for
the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks, offering significant spectral and
energy efficiency gains through user-centric operation of distributed access
points (APs). However, its reliance on low-cost APs introduces inevitable
hardware impairments, whose combined impact on wideband downlink systems
remains unexplored when analyzed using behavioral models. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) in cell-free
massive MIMO-OFDM systems under practical hardware impairments, including phase
noise and third-order power amplifier nonlinearities. Both centralized and
distributed precoding strategies are examined. By leveraging the Bussgang
decomposition, we derive an SE expression and quantify the relative impact of
impairments through simulations. Our results reveal that phase noise causes
more severe degradation than power amplifier distortions, especially in
distributed operation, highlighting the need for future distortion-aware
precoding designs.

Conclusion: 研究为无蜂窝大规模MIMO V-CRAN的资源管理优化提供了关键见解，推动了能效无线网络的实现。

Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in
virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising
architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and
energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we
develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of
cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs).
Specifically, we formulate a set of mixed-integer programming (MIP) models to
jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association,
cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum
total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios
based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical
results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power
consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces
TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in
cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless

Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN)
infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future
6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous
network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges
through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture
enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly
detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned
reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability.
Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages
multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and
external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network
conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that
the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions,
compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large
language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time
responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped
with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and
effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework
for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices
while preserving data privacy. However, FL deployments in wireless networks
face significant challenges, including communication overhead, unreliable
connectivity, and high energy consumption, particularly in dynamic
environments. This paper proposes EcoFL, an integrated FL framework that
leverages the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) architecture with multiple Radio
Access Technologies (RATs) to enhance communication efficiency and ensure
robust FL operations. EcoFL implements a two-stage optimisation approach: an
RL-based rApp for dynamic RAT selection that balances energy efficiency with
network performance, and a CNN-based xApp for near real-time resource
allocation with adaptive policies. This coordinated approach significantly
enhances communication resilience under fluctuating network conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate competitive FL model performance with 19\%
lower power consumption compared to baseline approaches, highlighting
substantial potential for scalable, energy-efficient collaborative learning
applications.

Result: AFDM在6G中展现出强大的潜力，特别是在物理层安全和波形设计方面。

Conclusion: AFDM是6G标准化的有力候选者，但仍需解决实际部署中的挑战。

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform
candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of
promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and
high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other
candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM
provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical
deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward
compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also
offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable
physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all,
this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a
candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise
introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM,
followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion
of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and
representative requirements.

Motivation: 探索在双基地ISAC系统中，如何通过优化波束成形设计，同时实现高效通信和精确目标感知。

Method: 推导了DoA估计的CRB，提出基于SCA的非凸优化方法设计波束成形，并对比了仅使用高斯信号与混合信号的性能。

Result: 数值结果表明，仅使用高斯信号会导致感知性能下降，而提出的设计在ISAC性能边界上优于基准方案。

Conclusion: 混合信号传输和优化波束成形设计能够显著提升ISAC系统的综合性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a bistatic integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) system, consisting of a multi-antenna base station (BS),
a multi-antenna sensing receiver, a single-antenna communication user (CU), and
a point target to be sensed. Specifically, the BS transmits a superposition of
Gaussian information and deterministic sensing signals. The BS aims to deliver
information symbols to the CU, while the sensing receiver aims to estimate the
target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to the sensing receiver by
processing the echo signals. For the sensing receiver, we assume that only the
sequences of the deterministic sensing signals and the covariance matrix of the
information signals are perfectly known, whereas the specific realizations of
the information signals remain unavailable. Under this setup, we first derive
the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DoA estimation and propose
practical estimators to accurately estimate the target's DoA. Subsequently, we
formulate the transmit beamforming design as an optimization problem aiming to
minimize the CRB, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirement at the CU and a maximum transmit power constraint at the BS.
When the BS employs only Gaussian information signals, the resulting
beamforming optimization problem is convex, enabling the derivation of an
optimal solution. In contrast, when both Gaussian information and deterministic
sensing signals are transmitted, the resulting problem is non-convex and a
locally optimal solution is acquired by exploiting successive convex
approximation (SCA). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that employing
Gaussian information signals leads to a notable performance degradation for
target sensing and the proposed transmit beamforming design achieves a superior
ISAC performance boundary compared with various benchmark schemes.

Motivation: 探索近场隐蔽通信的潜力，结合RSMA和RIS技术，以增强合法用户的信号并抑制对手的检测能力。

Method: 提出一种交替优化（AO）算法，结合两阶段迭代方法和低复杂度技术，优化BS和RIS的波束成形。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该算法显著提高了隐蔽通信速率，验证了近场RSMA-RIS集成的有效性。

Conclusion: 近场RSMA-RIS集成在隐蔽通信中具有显著潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper explores the near field (NF) covert communication with the aid of
rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS). In particular, the RIS operates in the NF of both the legitimate user
and the passive adversary, enhancing the legitimate users received signal while
suppressing the adversarys detection capability. Whereas, the base station (BS)
applies RSMA to increase the covert communication rate composed of a private
and a shared rate component. To characterize system covertness, we derive
closed form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP), outage
probability (OP), and optimal detection threshold for the adversary. We
formulate a non-convex joint beamforming optimization problem at the BS and RIS
under unit-modulus constraints to maximize the covert rate. To tackle this, we
propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, where the BS beamformer is
designed using a two-stage iterative method based on successive convex
approximation (SCA). Additionally, two low-complexity techniques are introduced
to further reduce the adversarys received power. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the covert communication rate,
highlighting the potential of near field RSMA-RIS integration in covert
communication.

Method: 利用Zak-OTFS的可预测性，实现跨时隙的准确信道估计和干扰消除。

Result: 在高移动性和用户密度下，显著降低了丢包率。

Conclusion: Zak-OTFS方案适用于未来大规模机器类通信部署。

Abstract: This paper proposes a grant-free coded random access (CRA) scheme for uplink
massive machine-type communications (mMTC), based on Zak-orthogonal time
frequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation in the delay-Doppler domain. The scheme
is tailored for doubly selective wireless channels, where conventional
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CRA suffers from
unreliable inter-slot channel prediction due to time-frequency variability. By
exploiting the predictable nature of Zak-OTFS, the proposed approach enables
accurate channel estimation across slots, facilitating reliable successive
interference cancellation across user packet replicas. A fair comparison with
an OFDM-based CRA baseline shows that the proposed scheme achieves
significantly lower packet loss rates under high mobility and user density.
Extensive simulations over the standardized Veh-A channel confirm the
robustness and scalability of Zak-OTFS-based CRA, supporting its applicability
to future mMTC deployments.

Conclusion: 验证后的NYURay提升了射线追踪的准确性，为6G部署提供了可靠的信道统计。

Abstract: Ray-tracing (RT) simulators are essential for wireless digital twins,
enabling accurate site-specific radio channel prediction for next-generation
wireless systems. Yet, RT simulation accuracy is often limited by insufficient
measurement data and a lack of systematic validation. This paper presents
site-specific location calibration and validation of NYURay, NYU's in-house ray
tracer, at upper mid-band frequencies (6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz). We propose a
location calibration algorithm that corrects GPS-induced position errors by
optimizing transmitter-receiver (TX-RX) locations to align simulated and
measured power delay profiles, improving TX-RX location accuracy by 42.3% for
line-of-sight (LOS) and 13.5% for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.
Validation across 18 TX-RX locations shows excellent RT accuracy in path loss
prediction, with path loss exponent (PLE) deviations under 0.14. While RT
underestimates delay spread and angular spreads, their cumulative distributions
remain statistically similar. The validated NYURay advances RT validation and
provides reliable channel statistics for 6G deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D空间转录组学中全采样成本高的问题，并克服现有方法依赖大数据集和域差异导致的泛化能力差。

Method: 采用2.5D采样（中心全采样，相邻稀疏采样）结合域自适应插值框架（包括对齐、伪监督生成和快速多域细化）。

Result: ST-DAI在显著降低测量负担的同时，实现了与全采样方法相当的基因表达预测性能。

Conclusion: ST-DAI为3D空间转录组学提供了一种高效且成本低廉的解决方案。

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of
fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although
recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods
require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from
substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new
samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST
that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample
domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D
sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while
other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing
volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we
propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate
fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only
sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain
discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that
first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates
dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast
Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the
adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of
Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a
Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their
estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression
prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while
substantially reducing the measurement burden.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可控扩散模型的方法（Control Copy-Paste），通过利用多样化的上下文信息提升小样本目标检测（FSOD）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小样本目标检测在光学遥感图像中面临数据分布不足和过拟合问题，现有方法仅增加目标多样性而忽略了上下文的重要性。

Method: 通过条件扩散模型将小样本目标无缝注入多样化上下文中，并开发了方向对齐策略以减少实例长宽比带来的失真。

Result: 在DIOR数据集上的实验表明，该方法平均提升了10.76%的检测性能。

Conclusion: Control Copy-Paste通过结合多样化上下文和方向对齐，有效解决了小样本目标检测中的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) for optical remote sensing images aims to
detect rare objects with only a few annotated bounding boxes. The limited
training data makes it difficult to represent the data distribution of
realistic remote sensing scenes, which results in the notorious overfitting
problem. Current researchers have begun to enhance the diversity of few-shot
novel instances by leveraging diffusion models to solve the overfitting
problem. However, naively increasing the diversity of objects is insufficient,
as surrounding contexts also play a crucial role in object detection, and in
cases where the object diversity is sufficient, the detector tends to overfit
to monotonous contexts. Accordingly, we propose Control Copy-Paste, a
controllable diffusion-based method to enhance the performance of FSOD by
leveraging diverse contextual information. Specifically, we seamlessly inject a
few-shot novel objects into images with diverse contexts by a conditional
diffusion model. We also develop an orientation alignment strategy to mitigate
the integration distortion caused by varying aspect ratios of instances.
Experiments on the public DIOR dataset demonstrate that our method can improve
detection performance by an average of 10.76%.

Motivation: 超声视频分析因非标准化采集和操作者偏差而具有挑战性，传统深度学习方法难以处理。

Method: 提出VidFuncta框架，扩展Functa的INR方法，将超声视频编码为紧凑的时间分辨表示，分离静态和时间依赖的调制向量。

Result: 在三个公开超声视频数据集上验证，VidFuncta在视频重建和下游任务（如射血分数预测、B线检测和乳腺病变分类）中表现优异。

Conclusion: VidFuncta作为一种通用且高效的表示框架，展示了在超声视频分析中的潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning
methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized
acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video
analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an
INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that
conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal
domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose
VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length
ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta
disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of
time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and
dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video
reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned
1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video
datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream
performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast
lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a
generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in
Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early
detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to
pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often
leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an
AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data,
leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and
738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models
(AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert
radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers
and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong
performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training
without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and
improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first
large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain.
However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation
model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a
two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked
autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture
rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive
learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,
facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect
16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.
Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates
and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based
on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive
learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the
effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12
independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the
evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated
across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,
information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP
exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the
prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at
