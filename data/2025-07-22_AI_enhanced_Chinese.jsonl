However, current methods for\nVO2max estimation, such as Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET), require\nexpensive equipment and the supervision of trained personnel, limiting\naccessibility for large-scale screening. Preliminary efforts have been made to\ncreate a more accessible method, such as the Cardiopulmonary Spot Jog Test\n(CPSJT). Unfortunately, these early attempts yielded high error margins,\nrendering them unsuitable for widespread use. In our study, we address these\nshortcomings by refining the CPSJT protocol to improve prediction accuracy. A\ncrucial contribution is improved feature extraction which include gender, body\nmass index, aerobic duration, and anaerobic duration. This targeted approach\nhelps in streamlining the model to enhance prediction precision while\nminimizing the risk of overfitting. In a cohort of 44 participants from the\nIndian population, we assessed the performance of various machine learning\nmodels using these features. With Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation, the Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE) values were 5.78 for Linear Regression, 5.15 for\nRandom Forest, and 5.17 for Support Vector Regression.

This paper investigates the problem of\nlocalizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment\nconsisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and\nmultiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem\nwithin an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first,\nthe optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight\n(NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to\nprevent interferences.

To understand the impact of network topology,\nhierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) investigated the communication and secret\nkey generation efficiency in a 3-layer relay network, where clusters of users\nare connected to the aggregation server through an intermediate layer of\nrelays. Due to the pre-aggregation of the messages at the relays, HSA reduces\nthe communication burden on the relay-to-server links and is able to support a\nlarge number of users. However, as the number of users increases, a practical\nchallenge arises from heterogeneous security requirements--for example, users\nin different clusters may require varying levels of input protection.

The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed\nperiodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate\nion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate\nacross 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the\nsensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at\nsites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the\nresults against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was\ntrained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3,\nzero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for\nriver samples.

We seek the optimal\ncombination of phase shifts across all the meta-atoms to maximize the channel\nstrength from transmitter to receiver.

The main idea is to extract the key\nfeatures of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS)\ndata via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a\nwindfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a\nnontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active\nsensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel\nestimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless\ncommunication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is\nthe RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is\nverified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band.

We employed\nthe nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D\nsegmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class\nschemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived\nfrom adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,\nkidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad\nbody-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested\non 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.\nPerformance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized\nSurface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the\nTumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation\naccuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)\nannotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%\nimprovement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.\nThe TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)\nand strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold\ncross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1\nto 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability.

Traditional approaches enforce\nhalf-wavelength or greater spacing among RA elements to avoid mutual coupling,\nlimiting the solution space. Additionally, achieving sufficient spatial channel\nsampling requires numerous discrete RA positions (ports), while high-frequency\nscenarios with hybrid processing demand many physical RAs to maintain array\ngains. This leads to exponential growth in the solution space. We propose two\ntechniques to address the former challenge: (1) surrounding a limited number of\nactive RAs with passive ones terminated to tunable analog loads to\n\\textit{exploit} mutual coupling and increase array gain, and (2) employing\ntunable loads on each RA in an all-active design to \\textit{eliminate} mutual\ncoupling in the analog domain. Both methods enable arbitrary RA spacing,\nunlocking the full solution space. Regarding the latter challenge, we develop\ngreedy and meta-heuristic port selection algorithms, alongside low-complexity\nheuristic variants, that efficiently handle over $10^{20}$ array\nconfigurations, and optimize the loading values to maximize the sum-rate in a\nmultiple-input single-output broadcast channel under transmission power\nconstraints, assuming a heuristic linear precoder.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\ndetecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth,\nand elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision\nencoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for\neach task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates\nin-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed\nspectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization\naccuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices\nrecorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and\ndemonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7bGNSS\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u65b9\u4f4d\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "GNSS\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\u5a01\u80c1\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfAoA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408IQ\u6837\u672c\u548cFFT\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\uff0c\u5f15\u516522\u4e2aAoA\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u5f84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce\nEndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with\nmask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic\nenvironments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference\nResetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with\ndynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while\nmaintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification\n(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores\nusing a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization\ndespite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive\nsoftening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that\nmodulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,\nor distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force\nattenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical\nscenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while\ndistance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow\nconditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four\ndifferent surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including\nocclusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.\nQuantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations\ndemonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in\nboth magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness\nacross challenging surgical conditions.

Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS)\nalgorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences.\nTypically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of\nnoise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence. To ensure the reliability of\nthe TDS algorithm, a crucial lemma is first established, indicating that the\ntrend sequence and fluctuation sequence obtained by the TDS algorithm are\nexistent and unique when the global smoothing parameter is determined. Three\nmodified algorithms are then proposed based on the TDS algorithm, with\ncorresponding lemmas and corollaries demonstrating their reliability.

One of the great strengths\nof wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\nis the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources\ncan be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in\ntime and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the\ninflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have\ndifferent sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier\ninterference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an\nalternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to\nOFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of\nOFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS\npulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource\nallocation.

The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM\nsingle-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in\nthe multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate\ntransition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each\nsubsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but\npossesses unique tunable design parameter values.

More specifically, we propose a mathematical\nmodel that relates the probability density function (PDF) of the signal\nbandwidth to the crowd size, using a principled derivation based on the PDF of\nan individual's fidget-induced bandwidth. To characterize the individual\nfidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated\nindividual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques,\nfollowed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from\nanalog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world\ndeployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an\nanomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our\nsystem through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes\nup to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a\nnormalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51\nseconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state\nof the art.

UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their\nmaneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to\ntransmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two\ntime slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication\nusers (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground\nlocations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from\ntargets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs\nbeamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode\ninformation from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern\nefficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective\noptimization problem to maximize both the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal\npower from the targets. This is achieved by finding the optimal power\nallocation for CUs in each UAV, subject to constraints on the maximum total\npower in each UAV and the transmitted beam pattern gain.

How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best\nperformance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds\non the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is\nmeasured in terms of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and\ncommunications performance is measured in terms of the\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires\nat most $K + \\sqrt{\\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the\nability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling\ninterference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes\n$\\sqrt{K^2 + \\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound\non the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task\nindividually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the\nperformance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the\nbeamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \\sqrt{d}$ and $\\sqrt{K^2 +\nd}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and\nangles-of-arrival of $N_\\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users,\nthe bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in\n$N_\\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When\ninterference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization\nfor the case of $N_\\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two\nbeamformers should be used; when $K \\ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be\nused, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5668\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ISAC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8eCram\u00e9r-Rao\u754c\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e72\u6270\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u9700\u8981K + \u221a(L(L+1)/2)\u4e2a\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5668\uff1b\u4e0d\u53ef\u6d88\u9664\u65f6\u4e3a\u221a(K\u00b2 + L(L+1)/2)\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u5931\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6570\u91cf\u968fK\u548cN_tr\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u5668\u6570\u91cf\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While machine learning has achieved expert-level\nperformance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable\nmultimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of\npublicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,\ndiagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide\nonly single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to\nbuild models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in\nreal-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext\nECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw\nwaveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual\ninterpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes\nbeat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering\nstructured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model\ninterpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the\nraw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature\nparameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved\nusing consistent, unique identifiers.

FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to\ncooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to\nshare the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made\nexisting FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication\noverhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated\ndistillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge\ndistillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing\nthe model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,\nare shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property\nof the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in\nover-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting\nthe power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the\nintractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex\nnature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate\nin over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'\ntransmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained\ngiven the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient\napproach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite\nrelaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the\noriginal and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design.

For more general scenarios, including those with mixed-DACs\nand/or an extended target, we develop a low-complexity\nmajorization-minimization (MM)-based algorithm to tackle the problem\niteratively.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA\narray-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a\nbase station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our\ngoal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while\nadhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving\nregion. The formulated problem is inherently highly non-convex, rendering it\nchallenging to acquire a globally optimal solution. As a compromise, we propose\na low-complexity two-stage optimization algorithm to obtain an effective\nsuboptimal solution. Specifically, in stage one, the SIC decoding order is\nfirst determined by solving a channel gain maximization problem. Then, in stage\ntwo, with the given SIC decoding order, the beamforming vectors, MA positions,\nand users' decoding indicator matrix are iteratively optimized by capitalizing\non alternating optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA), and genetic\nalgorithm (GA). Simulation results unveil that the sum-rate performance of the\nproposed MA-enabled downlink NOMA system significantly outperforms that of\nconventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Moreover, the results also\nshow that the antenna position optimization in the proposed algorithm can\nfurther enhance the advantages of NOMA over space division multiple access\n(SDMA).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\uff08MA\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u5740\uff08NOMA\uff09\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001SIC\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6307\u793a\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u6784\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u800c\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528MA\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u63d0\u5347NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u786e\u5b9aSIC\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u3001SCA\u548cGA\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001MA\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6307\u793a\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMA-NOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603b\u901f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86NOMA\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eSDMA\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MA\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e3aNOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
